Doing things fast is fun, but moving quickly without practice leads to mistakes. The best way to avoid this is to go slowly first. Speed comes from repetition[^Ben].

## Exercises
To improve finger speed - play slowly, almost with legato bowings (don't worry about articulation, that comes later too). This helps force you to keep the string pressed and move your fingers quickly[^strings]. Use a metronome. Avoid pauses and iron out mistakes—your practice habits become your performance habits!

To work out awkward octave jumps or very complicated fingerings, first think through the fingerings available. Sometimes there's a better option. Play what you can in each hand position, then *very very quickly* shift. Pause for a moment. Set your bow. Then play. And so on and so forth. Also consider [[music/backwards-practice|backwards practice]] with complex fingerings.

[^Ben]: This is the mantra of my first bass instructor.
[^strings]: Another thing that can help with keeping the strings pressed down even while shifting is leaning the bass. This can be awkard, so get someone else to help you if you're concerned. For the exercise, lean the bass very far forward so the neck is pressing into your fingertips as you play or shift. Run your fingerings forwards and backwards a few times, then return to normal playing—but remember the feeling!
