## About
This is my personal wiki.
It contains everything from recipes (with food) to recipes (with code) to notes on books and songs that I like.
The notes here are written for me, so they may be missing context or make herculean leaps in logic.

It also makes it easier for me to share recipes or book recommendations with friends, since websites are more friendly than text files.

## Colophon
I read articles in [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) and books in print.
I write in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), using [neovim](https://neovim.io/) and [obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
Notes are published using a modified version of [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and [hugo](https://gohugo.io).
This wiki is hosted through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
