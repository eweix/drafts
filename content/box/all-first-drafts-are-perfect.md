> Seriously. The idea of a "blog" needs to get over itself. Everybody is treating writing as a "content marketing strategy" and using it to "build a personal brand" which leads to the fundamental flawed idea that everything you post has to be polished to perfection and ready to be consumed.

Yeah, ditto on this. I tried keeping something like a blog for an undefined period of time, but I didn't enjoy it. The whole thing felt weirdly insincere. That's what I like about this wiki/drafts/digital garden schtick—you just write the things you want to write for you, then chuck it all onto the interwebz.
