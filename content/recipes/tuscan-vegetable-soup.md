Like minestrone soup, but on steroids.

## Ingredients
- 1 can cannellini beans
- 1 Tb olive oil
- 1/2 large onion, diced (~1 cup)
- 2 carrots, diced (~1/2 cup)
- 1 small zucchini, diced
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 Tb chopped fresh thyme (or 1 ts dried)
- 2 Tb chopped fresh sage (or 1 ts dried)
- 1/2 ts salt
- 1/4 ts ground pepper
- 4 cups chicken or veggie broth
- 14oz diced tomatoes
- 2oz baby spinach leaves (~2 cups)

## Instructions
1. Mash half of the beans in a small bowl.
2. Put oil in pan and heat on medium-high. Add onion, carrot, celery, zucchini, garlic, thyme, sage, salt, and pepper. Cook ~5 minutes until very tender.
3. Add broth, tomatoes, and bring to boil.
4. Add mashed and whole beans, and spinach. Cook about 3 minutes more.

## Notes
- I usually double this recipe, and add 1 cup quick barely + 2 cups water
