I've been reading all my life. One of my most vivid memories is of the first time I read *The Hobbit*. Every page, it seemed, made me fret at some new misfortune or laugh at a whimsical song or left me in awe of towering mountains and deep forests. I fell in love with gruff dwarves, eccentric wizards, and—of course—prudent hobbits that still expected to be home by supper. I devoured chapter after chapter until I had raced all the way to the Lonely Mountain and back. I've been captivated by the magic in those pages ever since.

In school, I was always that kid with the book in their hand: reading in between class, during free periods, even in the hallways. I had teachers talk to me and ask me to stop reading—a mixed message, I thought, since they asked my parents to sign a sheet of paper each evening affirming that I had, in fact, read for thirty minutes that night.

My siblings are the same way. I blame my parents, who read to us early and often. We developed habits around it, reading books before bedtime or after coming home from pre-school. My main complaint about the reading tests in grade school was that they wouldn't let me finish reading the whole book—the teachers would take it away after I read a few pages out loud! They had other students to test, of course.

So imagine my surprise when I heard that reading is on the decline in the United States. In brief, the poll shows that people are reading fewer books on average, down from 12.6 in 2016 to 15.6 in 2021. The portion of people reading is largely the same. But here's the excerpt that worries me most:

[https://news.gallup.com/poll/388541/americans-reading-fewer-books-past.aspx](https://news.gallup.com/poll/388541/americans-reading-fewer-books-past.aspx)

> "The new data on book reading reinforce that the popularity of reading is waning, with Americans reading an average of three fewer books last year than they did five years ago and had typically read for the past three decades. **The decline is not because fewer Americans are reading at all -- a percentage that has held steady at 17% -- but because Americans who do read are reading fewer books.** The changes are especially pronounced among the most voracious book readers, namely, college graduates, women and older Americans."

Only 17% of people surveyed read books! That's fewer than 1 in 5 people even touching a book! This tidbit is buried at the end up the article, but I think it might be most important information from the poll. There's a lot of reasons that people might read less—after all, time you spend reading might be time better spent working, with family, or any number of other things. It might be time you _need_ to spend on other things. And so you read less, or not at all.

It's the reading not at all that bothers me, because I've always felt that reading is such an enriching and wonderful thing. You can travel anywhere in the world through the pages of a book, or live another life entirely. You can learn about so many astounding things through books (and not just through nonfiction!).

After reading about the Gallup poll, I started thinking about the reasons _not_ to read. It could be something that you don't enjoy. But saying that you don't like reading is like saying, as a blanket statement, you don't like videos or podcasts or television. Books are a medium for so many things—if you don't like reading, it might be that you haven't found something you like to read yet.

The best two reasons I found, though, were culture-centered. One person in my English class noted that their grandparents don't read much anymore because they get that same sense of fulfillment and connection through spending time with their family. Makes sense to me—even I often prefer to spend time with family or friends instead of reading, and I'm the definition of a nerd.

The other reason is that many books available in the US are written in English. If English isn't your first language, translations might not be available, or you might have to just struggle through a book in a language that you may not be comfortable reading and thinking in. English is my first language, but I've read a few books in Spanish as part of my classes. It's _hard_ to read in a language you're not entirely comfortable or confident in! And it changes the experience of reading.

In that light, my teacher posed us a question: "how do we make reading literature, reading fiction, accessible?"

The answer: make a culture of it. I read early and often because of my parents, who made sure that reading was a part of our family's culture. But as my siblings and I grew older, we noticed that our dad didn't read much for himself anymore. Long hours spent writing papers and grant proposals chipped away at time he might've spent on a book. And, as many people do, he chose to spend the time he had left when he came home with us as a family. It's not a decision I disagree with—I can't put into words how thankful I am for the time I have with my family.

Then something changed. A few years ago, I started reading a very _very_ long collection of books by the author Brandon Sanderson. Series like _Mistborn_ and _The Stormlight Archive_ crept onto the shelves in our house, and my siblings both started reading them too. We'd talk about it at the dinner table, laughing about the characters or squealing over some new link between this series and that. Our parents both listened to us in mild confusion—to them, we were speaking another language. But nobody likes to be left out, least of all parents in the lives of their children. So our dad, lacking time to sit and read, found an audiobook he could listen to during his commute. Our mom did the same. Pretty soon, we were all talking together about it on walks or at meals.

Now, I recognize that not every social group is as nerdy as my family. When we do things, we tend to do them obsessively. I like to think that this mini-culture around these particular books helped to draw my parents back into reading—or listening, in this case. But it turns out that this principle is broadly applicable across all sorts of books, not just the works of Sanderson. In this article in the Berkeley Beacon, Rachel Hackam explores the emerging online trends around reading:

> "The summer before second grade, I caught the reading bug. With the help of the pandemic and online bookish content, many others have since caught it, too. Social media platforms like Youtube and Tiktok have romanticized reading, making the hobby trendy and changing young peoples' perceptions of literature."

There's a collection of cultures around reading now flourishing online, and I couldn't be happier for it. It points to the power of culture as a means of inclusion and connection.  

In their paper "Nobody Wants to Read Anymore! Using a Multimodal Approach to Make Literature Engaging" (Thompson and McIlnay 2019) suggest some more ways to increase accessibility in reading.

> "Ulin's son describes 'the systematic killing of the love of reading, often exacerbated by the inane, mind-numbing practices found in schools' that Gallagher (2009) refers to as readicide (p. 2). The question we should be asking isn't whether literature has value, but how we can help students engage with it."

> "In a study of middle-schoolers' reading preferences, Worthy and McKool (1999) found that literary works were largely unpopular with students, who preferred materials such as teen magazines and scary stories. Pitcher et al. (2007) studied the reading habits and interests of adolescents, finding that although students did not always consider themselves to be readers in the traditional sense, they discussed reading and writing in a variety of contexts. Students displayed signs of multiple literacy and discussed reading magazines, online articles, and reading and writing texts and emails, and expressed a preference in having a choice in what they read."

The worries about declines in reading (and other measures of education, for that matter) aren't new. They've been around almost as long as public education. But as new forms of media emerge, they compete for attention, so the things that people consume evolve and change. That seems sensible.

The thing that's really interesting to me here is the fact that students are reading all sorts of things _and discussing their preferences like they would with literary works_. That's pretty cool. I think it also points not to a decline in reading, but rather to a shift in what people are reading. Time that was once spent reading paperback books might now be spent on a webcomic, an online journal, or reading and writing in the blogosphere.

Adding some of these newer forms of media to lessons alongside print books might help to make them more accessible as well. While movies often suffer for being adaptations (and therefore less perfect forms) of books, they also aid in visualization and engagement for people who may struggle with reading. They serve to connect books to what students may engage with outside of school in their everyday lives.

The paper also includes some radical proposals for the multi-modal approach:

> "Similarly, comparing modern-day stories to the classics can provide a bridge that helps students connect with canonical texts that feel too far away from their life experiences; **the widely popular Twilight books and films can be read alongside Romeo and Juliet for a lesson on the literary trope of star-crossed lovers** and galvanizes student interest in employing multiple media to engage with literary texts."

But in all seriousness, offering more ways to interact with media is a good thing. I've seen this sort of approach already in my English class, where we would watch scenes from movie adaptations of books to get a sense of different angles and interpretations. We watched and read plays, and listened to audiobooks too. I've really enjoyed this class so far, and I hope to see more approaches like it in the future.

## tl;dr

There's a lot of stories about reading being on the decline, but studies show that's not quite the case! Current trends in social media point to developing community and culture around media as a way to increase accessibility. Including multiple types of media—such as movies, magazines, and modern novels—alongside literary classics can help students to engage with the texts while also fostering more independence and enjoyment.
