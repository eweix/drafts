## Notes
It was only this past year (2023) that I re-read notes I had taken for classes. In my math class, I was working on a proof and realized I didn't remember some foundational theorems for differential equations, so I paged through my notebook to find them. I finished the proof and moved on.

For me, notes are nice because I can trust that they'll hold on to information that I won't. Notes help me let go of thingsâ€”otherwise everything would live rent-free in my skull for weeks. Now it's just my obsessions!

## Flashcards
When I really want to put something away, I use flashcards. Done properly, they can help me [remember small details for months](https://ncase.me/remember/). Absolutely wonderful for history classes.
