## Thing-linking and Link-thinking
In the article [Make the Thing a Link](https://allenpike.com/2023/make-the-thing-a-link) , Allen Pike describes the convenience and accessibility of making the thing you are linking to the subject of the link. For example:

> "The [big-band cover of Still Alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22vbhTi1ieI) is a welcome remix to a classic song."

When you see the link, you can easily tell where it goes. It's much better than linking to generic terms like "read more" or "link" or "here." This is also interesting from a writing perspective, since it forces you to restructure some sentences and deviate from those tired designs.
