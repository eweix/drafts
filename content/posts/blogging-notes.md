## Textcasting
[Textcasting](https://textcasting.org/) is the idea that we should prioritize interoperability in internet writing, blogging, and other text communication. I think a lot of the interoperability here can be achieved using [RSS](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification#whatIsRss) (which is how podcasts work). The difficulty is in bringing that to people who aren't already entrenched in using RSSâ€”nobody wants to have definitions spouted at them when they ask how to follow news or blogs. Bottom line: if you're writing on line, I think you should have an RSS feed.

## Thing-linking and Link-thinking
In the article [Make the Thing a Link](https://allenpike.com/2023/make-the-thing-a-link) , Allen Pike describes the convenience and accessibility of making the thing you are linking to the subject of the link. For example:

> "The [big-band cover of Still Alive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22vbhTi1ieI) is a welcome remix to a classic song."

When you see the link, you can easily tell where it goes. It's much better than linking to generic terms like "read more" or "link" or "here." This is also interesting from a writing perspective, since it forces you to restructure some sentences and deviate from those tired designs.
