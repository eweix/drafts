Hello! Welcome to my giant stack of filing cabinets that I uploaded to the internet. If you're reading this right now, it probably means that this is your first time here. In that case, please let me say a few words.

## Structure
There are a few different sections to this website:
- [Collections](/collections) are bits of longer writing. Almost like blog posts, except that they're really a way to making something coherent things that are already on this website. These are revisited and revised sometimes, if I find new stuff that I think should be added.
- The [reading list](/books) is a list of books I have read in chronological order. It's listed this way so I have a decent idea of when I read something (since I always forget). Each book has an individual page that may or may not contain information about it and notes that I've taken.
- [Notes](/notes) are the meat of this website. These are smaller pages, usually under 300 words, and contain digested information about a lot of different topics. They're written for me, so they're not always the most comphrehensible.
- [Recipes](/recipes) are self-explanatory.

## How to read this website
This website is not laid out like a blog or a newsfeed. That's intentional. My latest writing is not necessarily my best writing. Instead of trying to find the most recently updated notes (though those are available at the [home page](/)), I encourage you to click through links and go down rabbit holes exploring stuff that interests you. And if you find something that you like, you can always bookmark it or copy it or save it for later somehow.

I suggest paging through the collections, finding something that interests you, and then chasing the source notes for that around for a little bit. Try not to spend too much time on this website thoughâ€”rabbit holes can be dangerous too.

## Recommended starting points
- Again, [collections](/collections) are a good place to start:
	- [[collections/inspiration-list|Inspiration list]] - a list of things that I like and think about a lot.
	- [[collections/digital-gardens|What are digital gardens?]] - an overview of websites like this one, and what they can do.
- My favorite stuff from my [notes](/notes):
- [Books](/books) that I enjoyed:
	- [[books/hedges_empire-of-illusion|Empire of Illusion]]
	- [[books/mukherjee_the-song-of-the-cell|The Song of the Cell]]
