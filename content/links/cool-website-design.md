A few websites with cool designs:

- [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/) has a really cool layout. I like how they handle the scrolling and use of sticky elements while still keeping to a finite home page (no infinite scroll).
- [Kottke](https://kotkke.org) has neat block-style quicklinks and posts. I like the [random selection](https://kottke.org/random) option that gives you a random set of posts.
- [Andy Matuschak's website](https://andymatuschak.org/) uses sliding panes to display pages. It's like an amped-up breadcrumb trail. This would be so cool on wikipedia!
- [(we)b.site](https://we-b.site/) hosts open letters to the internet. It's a cute list of notes, discussions, and monologues. The letters have little colored dots on them that show the number of people who have touched them.
