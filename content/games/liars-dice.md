[Liar's dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_dice) is a game that my friends and I picked up a year or so ago to pass the time as classes were ending. Turns out there's a whole family of games related to it, and it has some of its origins in the South American dice game [Dudo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudo). The only real restriction on these games is that you need to have friends and a lot of dice.

Liar's dice is, first and foremost, about bluffing. It's in the name. You need a healthy amount of luck for it (a good hand of dice makes it much easier to win). But it's also a game about math and probability, which means there's a place for skill at the table. 

The rules are deceptively simple, though I find them difficult to explain. I think they are best learned through play and demonstration, as in most things.
