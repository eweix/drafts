## How to read this website
This website is not laid out like a blog or a newsfeed. That's intentional. My latest writing is not necessarily my best writing. Instead of trying to find the most recently updated notes (though those are available at the [home page](/)), I encourage you to click through links and go down rabbit holes exploring stuff that interests you. And if you find something that you like, you can always bookmark it or copy it or save it for later somehow.

I suggest paging through the collections, finding something that interests you, and then chasing the source notes for that around for a little bit. Try not to spend too much time on this website thoughâ€”rabbit holes can be dangerous too.
