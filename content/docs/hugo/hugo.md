[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a static site generator written in [go](https://go.dev/).

[This wiki](/) runs on Hugo.

It's a little more complicated to use than Jekyll, but it's *much* faster and seems to work better for development. I ported all of my work over to Hugo this year, and I'm very satisfied with the build times (measured in milliseconds!).
