AlphaFold is an awesome system for predicting protein folding. It works quite well and has some versions you can use on the web. With a high-school issued chromebook and google cloud compute, I was able to compute several protein structures throughout the course of an hour-long workshop on using AlphaFold.

This is the link you want for using alphafold on google colab. It can run using google cloud compute (which uses google's machines and does not really put strain on your device). Alternatively, if you have a beefy computer, you can run it off of your local resources like a regular jupyter notebook. Very flexible and useful.

Structures can be viewed directly in the notebook, but it's better to look at them in a dedicated program like [[docs/pymol|PyMol]].

Play around with it! It's super cool and very fun to use.
