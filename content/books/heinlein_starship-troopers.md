*Starship Troopers* is a classic science fiction novel about the space military. It was one of the works that popularized power armor (which is kinda cool), and also one of many sci-fi works that focuses on conflict with alien species. As such, it has a healthy dose of xenophobia lumped in.

*Starship Troopers* reminds me a little bit of *Old Man's War,* but with more sexism and machismo. I feel like Scalzi's *Old Man's War* does the style and setting better. Meanwhile, *Starship Troopers* feels tired.
