*Starship Troopers* is a classic science fiction novel about the space military. It was one of the works that popularized power armor (which is kinda cool), and also one of many sci-fi works that focuses on conflict with alien species. As such, it has a healthy dose of xenophobia lumped in.

*Starship Troopers* reminds me a little bit of *Old Man's War,* but with more sexism and machismo.

Heinlein's sci-fi world is one of fascist militarism, and many of the classroom scenes
