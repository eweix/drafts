I think I have a new favorite book.

Becky Chambers's *A Psalm for the Wild-Built* is a beautiful book about a tea-brewing therapist in a post-cataclysm world going on a road trip with a robot.
Chambers's vivid prose brings to life a story about friendship, agency, and personal purpose.

The setting falls squarely in what my family and I lovingly call "[Ghibli apocalypse](https://www.ghibli.jp/gallery/nausicaa002.jpg)." Humanity has changed deeply, giving way to the natural world.
In this case, robots spontaneously gained consciousness and rejected their human-given purpose of servitude.
Contrary to the fictional trope of robot rebellion, humans assisted the robots in their liberation and ceded part of the world to them.
The world is barely recognizable—humans have learned to live in harmony with nature, satisfied without the exponential growth that we have come to expect.
I love this setting because of its innate hope and its vision of a world beyond ours.

The story centers around a tea-monk named Dex—they are a sort of therapist/herbalist, who listens to people and gives them tea.
Their profession is framed as a way of helping people find comfort in their existence, whether it's about learning to grieve or relaxing for a moment.
It's a sweet concept, and it characterizes the hope in this story.

There's also touches of [absurdism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism) in this story.
I haven't read many works of fiction featuring this philosophy (the only other one is [Kill Six Billion Demons](https://killsixbilliondemons.com/comic/kill-six-billion-demons-chapter-1/)), but the core message shines here.
It's more powerful if you sit down and read the book for yourself.
It's stubbornly hopeful and rejects purpose, so it's right up my alley.

The most fantastic thing in this book is not robots who have gained consciousness, but the fact that their computers are made to last a lifetime.
Ah, to imagine a world without planned obsolescence and easy repair.
