I would have gotten more out of this book if I were a software engineer or full-blown computer programmer. Much of the contents went over my head, since I'm not a member of that target audience. *The Mythical Man-Month* is dense and technical, so be prepared if you choose to read it.

Here are some of the key points as I understand them:
1. People and time are not perfectly interchangeable inputs on a project. Adding more effort without a clear vision for how it will be used only prolongs development.
2. Time is best saved through careful planning and scheduling, rather than adding more effort. More projects are strangled by poor planning and mismanaged deadlines than any other cause.
3. "Good cooking takes time." Defend that schedule.
4. Too many cooks spoils the broth. When working with large groups, divide them into surgical teams: everyone on the team working to support a lead programmer who completes the objective.
5. Plan for failureâ€”test often, test rigorously, and build in ample time for debugging.

These aren't all of the key points, but these are often repeated throughout the book or have entire chapters devoted to them.
