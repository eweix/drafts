*Sapiens* is not like your history textbooks.
It's a book about history, yes, and it covers the same span of time as a highschool or college world history class.
But Yuval Noah Harari achieves this in a conversational manner, like a fireside chat.
I had fun reading this book, although I did disagree with some of Harari's musings in the final chapter regarding limitless growth and resource crises.

If you want to learn more about world history, this book is for you.
A lot of folks seem to like it, and I'm one of them.
