I picked up this book because I wanted to learn about jellyfish and some of the biochemistry behind ageing.
What I got was a mix of pop science around ageing.
Nicklas Brendborg's discussion of the science of ageing is great.
I especially liked the chapter on rapamycin, a chemical that inhibits certain factors in cell growth.
I've used rapamycin in some experiments with cells, and I—like many other people—enjoy the familiar things in stories.

I wholeheartedly disagree with his refusal to take a stance on the ethics of stealing cells from Henrietta Lacks.
Her cells were taken by Dr.
Gey at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and redistributed without the consent of Lacks or her family, and I don't think there's any ethical defense of that.
Brendborg proposes an "ends justify the means" counterargument.
I don't think it holds water.
The scientists who did this were in the wrong, and there's a reason we have very strict ethics protocols around human cell lines.

While the science in Brendborg's proposals to extend human life is solid, I'd like to see more books about the topic that focus on *institutional* methods.
Things like eliminating pollution, establishing free high-quality healthcare, building affordable and accessible housing, and creating other public-facing infrastructure.
I want books that recognize and address life and longevity as all issues should be addressed—as they intersect with poverty, racism, ableism, and other causes for human rights.
