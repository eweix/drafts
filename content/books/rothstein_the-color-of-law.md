## Summary
Rothstein's book is a fantastic rebuttal to basically everything I learned about segregation in my high school history classes. *De facto* segregation is a myth, and we can't fight back against *de jure* segregation without a means of *de jure* integration. Decades of systemic oppression by government agencies, public policy, and exploitative economic practices got us where we are today. Conscious decisions got us here, not unfortunate legacies.

## Notes

### The myth of *De facto* desgregation
> "…remedies are inconceivable so long as citizens… continue to accept the myth of *de facto* segregation."
> 
> —<cite>Richard Rothstein</cite>

*De facto* segregation (at least, as far as "unintentional" segregation as a consequence of slavery) is a myth. *De jure* segregation (that is, segregation by government policy) was and is the reality of segregation in the United States.

Although racial disparities in income and assets are often fingered as the main reason for *de facto* segregation, these differences historically were caused by public policies: income suppression via excluding African-American-dominated industries from minimum wage and certain labor protections, for example. This is segregation *de jure*.

If we believe segregation to be incidental, then we fall into the trap of addressing it like an incidental problem. If we believe segregation is mostly the fault of misguided hearts and minds, then we risk addressing it as such. The only way to achieve racial integration and abolish segregation is with public policies as aggressive (or moreso) than those that caused it.

### Housing is intrinsically tied to civil rights
Housing is tied to civil rights. Without policies that protect housing rights for all, the US betrays the ideals of the Constitution.

> "…You have no right to use housing against civil rights… Housing is advanced in the intent of the general welfare and the interest of strenghtening democracy. When you separate civil rights from housing you weaken that general welfare."
> 
> —<cite>Vito Marcantonio</cite>

### Racial zoning is used to enforce *de jure* segregation
Racial zoning has two main parts:
1. Keeping African Americans out of white neighborhoods by making it difficult for lower-income families to afford living there.
2. Protecting white neighborhoods by directing industrial businesses or those that produce toxic waste away. These businesses then go to their alternative, which is often sites close to African-American neighborhoods.

This lowers property values near African-American neighborhoods but protects property values in white neighborhoods. Because these zonings are often protected or enforced by public policy, this makes it *de jure* segregation.

### The FHA plays a role in *de jure segregation*
The Federal Housing Administration systematically denied financing and approval for projects designated for African-Americans, while approving those for whites (i.e. Levittown). The FHA also refused to approve mortgages and loans for African-Americans, denying African-Americans any form of financial support (even under the GI bill). Without the means, it became near-impossible to move into suburbs, which contributed heavily to segregated housing.

### Restrictive covenants
Restrictive covenants are terms on property deeds that restrict selling to certain groups. They are unconstitutional, unlawful, and utterly repugnant, but they were used to prevent homeowners in white developments from selling to African-American buyers who did have the means to afford those homes.

### Local policies and tactics were used to enforce segregation
Tools such as zoning condemnation and city planning were used to segregate neighborhoods by either encouraging white flight or forcing African-Americans to move. School placement was key in city planning.

### When all else failed, state-supported violence enforced segregation
African-Americans who dared try to integrate into white suburbs or other developments all faced the same response: vicious attacks by white supremecists. Police would stand idly by or even encourage angry mobs that attacked the homes of African-American families. District attorneys would refuse to prosecute the criminal acts, and higher-ups in the police forces would turn a blind eye. Because the State could reasonably be said to know that this would happen (given that the superiors of those involved were usually either aware or directly complicit), this could be called state-sanctioned violence.

Even more galling is the fact that the State would sometimes retaliate against the targets of the violence, arresting them for "disturbing the peace" or "unlawfully" buying homes bound by restrictive covenants.
