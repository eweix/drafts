*Animal Farm*, by George Orwell, is a satirical novel about fascism and communism.
Framed as a fairy tale about a group of animals that overthrow their farmer, *Animal Farm* chronicles the farm's slow descent into tyranny as the pigs gain more and more power as the governing body.

*Animal Farm* is an allegory for the Russian Revolution, with different animals representing different groups during the revolution or lived in the society that followed.
Mollie the horse, for example, represents Russian aristocracy that fled the Bolshevik takeover.
The book makes much more sense when viewed through a historical lens, and it's all the richer for it.

I'd highly recommend reading this if you haven't read it in a literature class alreadyâ€”it's short, chilling warning against blind faith and autocrats.
I think we could use more of those warnings today.
