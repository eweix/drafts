Toni Morrison is a fantastic author, and Song of Solomon is not an exception to that rule.
Like in her other works, Morrison fills every sentence in *Song of Solomon* with nuance and symbolism.
I read this book as part of one of my projects for a literature class, and ended up spending almost a week trying to make sense of it afterwards.
In other words: this book is *dense*.
Sometimes it demands rereading the same paragraph—or even the same sentence—multiple times to understand all the sigificance.

In the foreward of the book, Morrison offers an example:
> "'The North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance agent promised to fly from Mercy to the other side of Lake Superior at 3:00.'"
> 
> "… It has the tone of an everyday event of minimal local interest, yet I wanted it to contain important signs and crucial information.
The name of the insurance company is that of a well-known black-owned company dependent on black clients… The sentence starts with 'North Carolina' and closes with 'Lake Superior'—geographical locations that suggest a journey from South to North."

And Morrison continues laying out the significance of every single word in that sentence for the rest of the page.
While not every sentence is like this, many of them are.
And each one builds on the others masterfully.
That's the style of writing you have here.
Song of Solomon is a book you can sit down and read in an afternoon, but it invites you to spend so much more time considering it.

Morrison's books deal with a lot of heavy themes, from racism to misogyny to familial abuse.
Her characters, for all of their struggles, are unspeakably human, which can make it all the more painful to see them through their trials.
I cried reading this book, and there were pages where I had to sit for a bit with the weight of the words before I could continue.

*Song of Solomon* in particular is unique among Morrison's works in that it was a departure from the female-focus of her other works, centering instead around a man and his story.
But Morrison does not leave women behind in her book, instead describing the ways a woman's interactions with society change if a man leaves her behind, as well as revealing the double standards faced by women daily, hourly, constantly.

I recommend this book.
There's a reason Morrison is one of the most celebrated authors in the literary canon.
This is my first time reading one of Morrison's books, and I'm eager for more.
I might have to wait a bit before tackling another, though.
