One of my friends reminded me that this book existed last week.
I borrowed it out as an ebook this morning and read it on the bus.
*Dr.
Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde* is part of a collection of books that very many people know of—and can even summarize—but have not read.
My familiarity stems from [variations](https://www.theglassscientists.com/comic/page-04) on Jekyll and Hyde throughout the [internet](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde) and [pop culture](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800080/).

Anyways.
*Dr.
Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde* is a quick read, barely 80 pages long.
It was written in 1903, and Stevenson's prose shows just how much English has changed in the past 120 years.
It's quite readable, but the book shows its age through peculiar turns of phrase and sentence construction.
Some of the words use "th" instead of "d" in spelling.

The narrative itself is split into two portions.
The first is written in third-person, following Mr.
Utterson's investigation into the titular case of Mr.
Hyde.
The second part is a series of letters and written testimony from several characters involved in the case.
Reading this book would be a very different experience for me had I not known the plot beforehand, as *Dr.
Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde* is a mystery novel.
Even so, I had fun reading the book, especially Doctor Jekyll's final testimony at the conclusion.
It's a book that's worth reading to fully understand exactly what Jekyll and Hyde originally were.
