Wendy Xu's *Tidesong* is a graphic novel about a girl who goes to study magic with her great-aunt.
The artwork is beautiful.
*Tidesong* would be worth reading for that alone, but the heartwarming story makes it all the better.
It's a book about family (as many good stories are) and learning that you are enough as you are.
I highly recommend this book.
