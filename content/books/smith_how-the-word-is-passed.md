*How the Word Is Passed* is a great introduction to the history of systemic racism.
Clint Smith tells the story of racism through places, in a sort of museum-learning style.
I don't have much else to say except that you should go read it.
Smith approaches racism thoughtfully, with clear writing and thorough explanationsâ€”even if you know little on the subject going in, you'll learn and understand a lot.
I'd like to have read books like this in U.
S.
History at my high school alongside our textbooks.
