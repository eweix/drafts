*Hood Feminism* is a collection of essays about feminism, racism, poverty, and change.
Each essay focuses on a different issue: hunger, racist beauty standards, the systemic exclusion of non-white needs from mainstream feminism, and other topics.
Kendall's arguments are thoughtful and passionate, fueled by righteous anger.

Mikki Kendall's *Hood Feminism* is a must-read for anyone interested in understanding the intersections of feminism and other social liberation movements.
