Full disclosure: everything I knew about *Moby Dick* before reading this novel came from [*Bone* by Jeff Smith](https://www.boneville.com/).
I did not know what I was in for.

Herman Melville's *Moby Dick* is a strange book.
The first fifteen or so pages are filled with nothing but quotes about whales from all sorts of texts, from the bible to the writings of Pliny the Elder.
I had no idea what I was getting into when I started reading it, save that it was long and dense.
Some number of hours of victorian prose about whales later, I'm done.

*Moby Dick* moves at a ponderous pace.
Melville lingers on the details of whaling and butchering, and deigns to spend whole pages on Ishmael extolling the virtures of whalers.
The details are rich, similar to Robert Jordan's writing in *The Wheel of Time*, and it's just as dense.
Almost all of the action happens in the final hundred pages of the book.
But the four hundred or so pages before the plot feel like a preamble, but I think that I also wasn't reading closely enough.
The next time I go through this book, I'll read it slower.

Unfortunately, *Moby Dick* did not age all that well.
Melville's plot doesn't hinge on racist stereotypes, but he sure does make use of them in his writing.
So. Uh. Not winning "most progressive classic novel" by any margin.
I have a sinking feeling I'll run into more of this as I make my way through the Western literary canon.
