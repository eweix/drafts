Isaac Asimov's *Foundation* is a sci-fi novel that follows statistician Hari Seldon and his disciples as they work to mitigate a galactic disaster.
It's a solid read, though the story does focus more on sweeping arcs of time, zooming in at key moments to follow critical actors.
I was a little surprised by the scope of the first book, especially because I came into these after watching the TV show.

I love the math representation here.
In *Foundation*, mathematician Hari Seldon uses a branch of statistics dubbed "psychohistory" to predict the future of enormous populations (read: on the scale of a galactic empire) with astounding accuracy.
It's a really cool idea, and it almost sounds plausible given the power of statistics, though I have absolutely no idea how it would work.
I like that Asimov doesn't try to make up a BS explanation filled with science buzzwords, and instead leaves psychohistory as an abstract concept—it feels more believable when nobody declares that all you have to do to account for X is to change the Plank constant.

My main gripe with this book is that the characters rotate in and out so often that it's difficult to stay attached to them—your favorite protagonist in one chapter might be but a footnote to history in the next.
Even the first book covers some three or four different generations of characters.
That didn't stop me from liking *Foundation*—but it's not the sort of character-driven book that I'm used to reading.

This is one of the rare instances where I like the TV adaptation as much or more than the source material.
*Foundation* the book and *Foundation* the TV series are two different stories.
The novel isn't afraid to jump eras at will, and only spends as much time as necessary on individuals as they confront the latest crisis.
The TV series lingers on more mundane moments, focusing in on characters across two or three different eras and following their stories in parallel.
I love the art direction of the show, and I think the creative liberties taken there ultimately change the story for the better.

If you watched the show, read the book.
If you're going to watch the show, read the book.
And if you don't plan on watching the show, I still think the book can be fun to read—Asimov is celebrated as one of the best science fiction writers for good reason.
