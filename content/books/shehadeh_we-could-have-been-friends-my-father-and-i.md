Raja Shehadeh's *We Could Have Been Friends, My Father and I* is part-memoir, part-history, and part-biography.
In it, Shehadeh chronicles his father's long fight for Palestinian liberation.
Shehadeh's story is at once inspiring and saddening.
I'm going to read more books on the topic of Israel and Palestine in the future, but this was a compelling introduction.
