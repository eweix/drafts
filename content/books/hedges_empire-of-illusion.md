## Context
Hedges wrote *Empire of Illusion* during 2009, during the middle of an economic recession. Near the midway point of Obama's second term. After looking up some reviews, I saw it described as a [jeremiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiad) - a lament about the downfall of society. I'd say that's an accurate description.

## Summary
In *Empire of Illusion*, Chris Hedges describes the United States as a declining culture—our hearts and minds captured by artifice, our education dictated by corporations, and our politics increasingly privatized. We have bought into a false reality, Hedges argues.  Hedges alludes to Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World*, discussing a society controlled not by pain, but by pleasure—a world destroyed by "what we love." Unless we face reality and pull the wool from our eyes, we will forever remain under the thumb of exploitative corporations, and the U. S. will fall into disarray.

## Notes
- I do disagree with Hedges on academics, though when he writes "academic" he seems to mean "economist" half of the time.
