## Context
Hedges wrote *Empire of Illusion* during 2009, during the middle of an economic recession. After looking up some reviews, I saw it described as a [jeremiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiad) - a lament about the downfall of society.

# Summary
In *Empire of Illusion*, Chris Hedges describes the United States as a declining cultureâ€”our hearts and minds captured by artifice, our education dictated by corporations, and our politics increasingly privatized.

I disagree with Hedges on academics, though when he writes "academic" he seems to mean "economist" half of the time.
