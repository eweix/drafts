## Context
Hedges wrote *Empire of Illusion* during 2009, during the middle of an economic recession. Near the midway point of Obama's second term. After looking up some reviews, I saw it described as a [jeremiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiad) - a lament about the downfall of society. I'd say that's an accurate description.

## Summary
In *Empire of Illusion*, Chris Hedges describes the United States as a declining culture—our hearts and minds captured by artifice, our education dictated by corporations, and our politics increasingly privatized. We have bought into a false reality, Hedges argues.  Hedges alludes to Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World*, discussing a society controlled not by pain, but by pleasure—a world destroyed by "what we love." Unless we face reality and pull the wool from our eyes, we will forever remain under the thumb of exploitative corporations, and the U. S. will fall into disarray.

## Notes
- I do disagree with Hedges on academics, though when he writes "academic" he seems to mean "economist" half of the time.

### Artifice
> "The most essential skill in political theater and a consumer culture is artifice. Political leaders, who use the tools of mass propaganda to create a sense of faux intimacy with citizens, no longer need to be competent, sincere, or honest. They need only appear to have these qualities. Most importantly, they need a story, a personal narrative. The reality of the narrative is irrelevant. It can be completely at odds with the facts. The consistency and emotional appeal of the story are paramount. Those who are best at deception succeed. Those who who have not mastered the art of entertainment, who fail to create a narrative or do not have one fashioned for them by their handlers, are ignored. They become 'unreal.'"

Artifice is the skill of faux intimimacy. Through manufactured events and stories, politicians, CEOS, and others build false connections with their audience. Controlling the emotions of others becomes the goal, rather than appealing to their needs or treating them as intelligent thinking beings.

### Jargon as a means of exclusion
Consider accessible and inaccessible language. Hedges refers to most technical terms in academics as inaccessible (though see note on economists), and seems to claim that academics "retreat" into the language of their field to avoid explaining or engaging in honest conversation. I disagree with this on the basis that I have spoken a lot of scientists in the life sciences and physical sciences, and all of them are very enthusiastic about talking about their work. It's not a conscious decision to exclude people; at worst, I would say it's the curse of knowledge. Once you know certain things about a subject, it's hard to think about what it would be like not to know those things, and your explanations reflect that.

All that aside, jargon does exclude people (intentionally or not). Hedges likens these difficultues in communication to sectorial languages, as if we have been cursed with fragmented communication after building a tower of babel.

### Corporate education
Hedges argues that our colleges and universities are no longer truly places of higher education. Instead, they have pivoted to the goal of vocational training and certification. This gets back to the typical thing I hear about liberal arts educations, and how we no longer value training people to think. I take this with a grain of salt. Hedges bases his argument mainly on the rise of for-profit universities (which arguably shouldn't be a thing) and corporate donations that sustain universities.  percentage has hovered at above 65% since the early 2000s[^statistics].

That being said, I love the liberal arts. I had a lot of fun with my literature and government classes, and I've come to appreciate history. Without this sort of education, I never would have discovered my love of writing or music.
