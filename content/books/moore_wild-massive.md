*Wild Massive* by Scotto Moore is like *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* but the universe is inside a building and features amusement parks.
I was laughing half the time reading it.
Moore's writing is outrageous and downright silly at times, and the narrative complements it in every way.
The fourth wall does not survive.
I think my only critique is on the amount of [lampshading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1gzqtwrutw)â€”I felt it kind of took away from the ending.
