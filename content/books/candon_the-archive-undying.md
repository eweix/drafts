Emma Mieko Candon's *The Archive Undying* is a bizarre, semi-apocalyptic, scrap-punk sort of story.
The narration swaps between first-, second-, and third-person, sometimes reaching all three within a single chapter.
It's a little confusing at times, but it's a really good book. I enjoyed reading it.
