This book.
Oh boy this book.
Ralph Ellison is a phenomenal writer.
I loved reading *Invisible Man.* It's a brilliant story, but to simply call it a novel is reductive.
*Invisible Man* is a novel about individuality and identity, the struggles of African Americans in the 1900s, Marxism, and a million other things.

This is one of those books that I feel I could read and re-read—every scene is rich in detail, both in sensory and in thought.
I lack for things to say because I still haven't finished processing everything.
I found myself going over the same sentece again and again, combing the page until I made sense of those scant few words and then moving onto the next.
*Invisible Man* is dense—and it's not empty calories.

One of the symbols in this book was pointed out to me by my English teacher before I had even begun reading the book: the name of the narrator, the titular Invisible Man, is never once given.
Oh, there are moments that allude to a name, and he is called a name—but it is not *his* name.
It doesn't feel right to talk about him without a name.
That's important.
It's supposed to feel uncomfortable to talk about people who have been erased like him.

At no point does this book feel slow.
The pacing of the plot comes and goes like the tide, but it always sits heavily on the page.
As I mentioned, I want to read this book again to better understand it.
It's worthwhile to take your time with this one.
