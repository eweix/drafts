*A Prayer for the Crown-Shy* is a worthy sequal to [[books/chambers_a-psalm-for-the-wild-built|A Psalm for the Wild Built]].
This book, too, reads like a fairy tale, though this is more of a "stranger in a strange land" situation.
We learn more about the world of Panga through Dex's guidance and Mosscap's wide eyes.
I don't have much to say that I haven't already said about the first bookâ€”if you liked that, then there's more of it here and it's great.
