*Hooky* by Míriam Tur is a cutesy book about a pair of siblings trying to get through the year after accidentally missing the bus to their boarding school.
Oh, and they're also witches and maybe their parents are evil? It's fun, the art is adorable, and I felt like the sibling dynamic was well-done (as someone with siblings).
Go read it.
