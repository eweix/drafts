If I had to describe this book in a single sentence it would be "It's like John Wick but with middle-aged women." The title, *Killers of a Certain Age*, makes it sound like a mystery or suspense novel, but the book feels like that weird "revenge roadtrip" that more than a few movies seem to love.
Y'know, the kind where someone attacks a retired hitman or assassin, and said mercenary comes out of retirement specifically to exact vengeance? Yeah, that sort of book.
It's not really a comedy, but there's a certain element of absurdity there.

Deanna Raybourn's *Killers of a Certain Age* is just that.
The story's pretty good.
The characters are delightfully blas√© when it comes to assassinations, though I appreciate that they shun the [ultraviolence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx_nCYQUzqo) (warning: ultraviolence) of cinema.
There's a few points where the protagonists laugh at the "new generation" of grenade-toting mercenaries and their imprecision.

It's not a perfect book, but heavens was this a fun one to read.
