*The Butchering Art* is another fantastic work of scientific and historical journalism, chronicling the transformation of Victorian medicine through the life of Joseph Lister—the surgeon who pioneered sterilization via carbolic acid.
I remember reading about him alongside other giants like Pasteur in biology class, so I'm glad to have the opportunity to read more in-depth about his life and achievements.
Lindsey Fitzharris spins a gripping story of scientific inquiry and advancement in the age that transformed surgery into a true practice of healing.

I like this book.
It's not for everyone—some of the details about the surgeries can get quite gruesome, even when described abstractly.
But it's still a page-turner (I finished it in a single day) and I'd recommend this for anyone interested in medicine or history.
Fitzharris provides ample context for making sense of these historical figures, and I learned a lot reading this book.

It reminds me of books written by [Deborah Blum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Blum#Bibliography).
*The Butchering Art* would not be out of place on a bookshelf next to *The Poisoner's Handbook* or *The Disappearing Spoon*—in fact, that's where it sits on my bookshelf-wall at home.
