Malka Older's *The Mimicking of Known Successes* is a nice, if relatively straightforward, mystery novel.
It's also a romance.
The setting is neat, but nothing about this book really stuck out to me.

I don't have anything bad to say about it.
My only issue with this book is that Older dared to use a [gerund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerund) in the title.
