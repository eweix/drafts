*The Rock Eaters* is an anthology by Brenda Peynado.
The stories within range from magical realism to speculative fiction to science-fiction.
They are not happy stories.
Some are full of hope, others bittersweet sorrow.
My favorite story—and the one that first convinced me to read this—is the titular short, *The Rock Eaters*.
It's an overt allegory of emigration, imperialism, and family, and the pain of disconnecting from your culture.
I read it as a prompt in a test, then looked up the book as soon as I finished writing my essay.
Funny how that happens.
I highly recommend reading this book.
