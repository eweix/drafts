# Summary
In *The Timeless Way of Building*, Christopher Alexander describes the (somewhat mystical) practices of making good buildings—buildings that promote use and life. This sort of character he terms "the timeless quality" or "the quality without a name." Though it defies description, the quality without a name is what gives the places we love that sort of special feeling and atmosphere.

To build good buildings, Alexander asserts, we must think in patterns. All places are really defined by the things that happen in them day-to-day. These events create the character of a place, much as a wagon wheel makes a rut in a path. So we must consider these patterns, think of the patterns we want, and build things that invite those patterns.

The act of design, too, must be done in patterns. The relationships between things—the *narrow hallway* that has *rooms on both sides* and connects to a *common place* with a *cooking place* is a basic set of places and relationships that make up the pattern for a floor of a residence hall. Instead of creating rigid modularity, these patterns give us a set of rules we can use to generate or grow a building—a starting seed to plant. With these patterns in mind, multiple people can work together to build this sort of building with less friction and more consistency. The collection of these patterns is a pattern language, and we can learn them just like languages.

# Notes
- The timeless way of building is natural, but to achieve it we must shed our preconcieved systems and methods. It defies systems and methods, which by their nature are modular—and therefore lack the quality without a name.
- The nameless quality is the unifying characteristic of good buildings (there is such a thing as objectively good and objectively bad buildings). The nameless quality is: alive, whole, comfortable, free, exact, egoless, and eternal.
- The timeless quality is present in the special moments in our lives, where we feel most whole and alive. Think of a moment where everything just felt "right," all at home in its place. That is the timeless quality.
- The character of something—a place, a tool, a person—is given by the events that occur with(in) it most often. The little day-to-day things make us who we are.
- Cultures are made of patterns of memetic events. This is the structure of the world.
- A pattern is: space + events. These two cannot be separated. Space and events help define one another.
- The "atomic" units of a pattern are those that repeat. If churches are different every time, the church itself is not atomic. What is?
	- The events that happen inside. Community gathering, worship, and other events repeat day to day and define the pattern of the church.
- The structure of a region is defined by patterns of relationships, which must be internally consistent.
- Patterns are sets of morphological relationships in space: $$X \to r(A,B, \dots)$$ where in context $$X$$, parts $$A,B, \dots$$
are related by relationship $$R$$
