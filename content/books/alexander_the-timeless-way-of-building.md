# Summary
In *The Timeless Way of Building*, Christopher Alexander describes the (somewhat mystical) practices of making good buildings—buildings that promote use and life. This sort of character he terms "the timeless quality" or "the quality without a name." Though it defies description, the quality without a name is what gives the places (and moments) we love that sort of special feeling and atmosphere.

To build good buildings, Alexander asserts, we must think in patterns. All places are really defined by the things that happen in them day-to-day. These events create the character of a place, much as a wagon wheel makes a rut in a path. So we must consider these patterns, think of the patterns we want, and build things that invite those patterns.

The act of design, too, must be done in patterns. The relationships between things—the *narrow hallway* that has *rooms on both sides* and connects to a *common place* with a *cooking place* is a basic set of places and relationships that make up the pattern for a floor of a residence hall. Instead of creating rigid modularity, these patterns give us a set of rules we can use to generate or grow a building—a starting seed to plant. With these patterns in mind, multiple people can work together to build this sort of building with less friction and more consistency. The collection of these patterns is a pattern language, and we can learn them just like languages.

# Notes

### [[notes/16_building should be natural|Building should be natural]]
Too often when we build things, we seek to impose some imagined order from the top downwards. We conceive a blueprint on paper, following some rules we have learned, and try to optimize the building. But buildings do not need to be optimized—it removes the nameless quality from them.

Do not make buildings modular—it destroys the soul of the building and makes it feel dead.

### [[notes/16a_the timeless quality distinguishes good buildings|All good buildings have the timeless quality]]
All good buildings (and many other good works of design) share the same timeless (and nameless) quality. Think of the moments in your life where everything just felt "right." That is the timeless quality. To achieve this quality, we must understand the event patterns that will shape the character of the building, and then we must build with spacial patterns that invite these events.

### [[notes/16a1a_patterns are made of spaces and events|Spaces + Events = Patterns]]
Patterns are made of spaces and events. These cannot be separated from one another. Space gives rise to events, and events give context to space. These are the basic elements that repeat in a pattern.

Patterns can also be thought of like morpholoical laws: $X \to r(A,B, \dots)$ where in context $X$, parts $A,B, \dots$ are related by relationship $R$.

### [[notes/16a1_the world is made of patterns|The world is made of patterns]]
The character of something—a place, a tool, a person—is given by the events that occur within and around it most often. The little day-to-day things make us who we are. The patterns of the world propogate themselves, creating culture and other cohesive images.

### [[notes/16a1b_patterns-are-shareable-languages|Patterns are shareable languages]]
If we think of a person's collective knowledge of patterns like a language, then the patterns are words, patterns that connect patterns are grammar/syntax rules, and buildings and places are sentences.

Every person has a pattern language that describes their experiences with building. This language is vital to building. By sharing these languages with other people or building a collective pattern language, we can more easily collaborate on building and design. This is sort of like equalizing expectations before working on a project.
