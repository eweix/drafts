*The Future is Disabled* by Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha reads like a good kick in the teeth.
Their writing feels like someone is talking to you.
It's confrontational, demanding, honest, and it flows.
If you're going to read essays on disability justice, I'd recommend reading this book and *[Care Work](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781551527383)*.

Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha has a number of other books.
I read *Care Work* last year at the recommendation of a good friend.
I'm looking for the others now, and they'll make an appearance here sooner or later.
