My parents gave me this book as a Christmas gift.
I had been working in a lab with cells and all sorts of other things for about six months by then, and I was (and still am) convinced that research was *the* place to be.
Thus, the book.
About cells.
I also received [[books/mukherjee_the-gene|The Gene]], another fantastic book written by Mukherjee, that I still have not finished reading.

In *The Song of the Cell*, Mukherjee describes cells and their interactions, slowly building up the the crowning discussion of the book: gene therapy and its consequences.
From the get-go, this book is engaging.
I fully admit that part of this is because I've taken classes about biology and cells and I work with cells on a weekly basisâ€”my love for this book is inseparable from my love of the lab.
