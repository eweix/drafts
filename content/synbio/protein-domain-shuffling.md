## Lateral domain shuffling
Typical protein-based design strategies rely on breaking a protein down into individual domains. Modular domains can then be used to design new constructs and networks.

For example, you could take sensor domain from a protein and attach it to something else, or swap around the domain that starts signal transduction. You could end up changing the stimuli or response to it, and thus influence overall cell dynamics!

The difficulty with this strategy is that you never know quite what you're going to get from your new constructs. Removing one domain might ruin the protein folding and then break your whole peptide chain!

## Circular permutation
The alternative approach to domain shuffling is to reuse domains from the same protein, but in a different order. While this is much more difficult to do well than lateral domain shuffling, it can produce very interesting results (like circular fluorescent proteins[^circular-gfp]).

It's called circular permutation because you put the end of the protein at the front, typically.
