Yeast have three primary types of [[synbio/yeast-vectors|expression vectors]]: integrating plasmids, cen-ARS plasmids, and 2-micron plasmids. Genes of interest must be cloned into these for yeast experimentation.

## Integrating Plasmids
These are integrated directly into the yeast genome. You have to digest these and make a cut in the yeast's DNA to integrate it.

## Cen-ARS Plasmids
Centromere Autonomous Replicating Sequence

## 2-Micron Plasmids
