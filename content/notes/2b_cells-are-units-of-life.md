*Omnis cellula e cellula*. All cells come from cells. Such states cell theory, one of the key ideas in biology.

Cells are the atomic units of life. When you group many of them together, you get organisms through [[notes/1_emergence|emergence]] (building on the idea that [[notes/1b_life-is-emergent|Life is an emergent phenomenon]]). [[notes/2b1_living-phenomena-can-be-understood-through-cells|All living phenomena can be understood through cells]], so long as those phenomena occur in things made of cellsâ€”understanding those fundamental units tells us more about the global effects.
