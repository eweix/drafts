Complex systems are emergent phenomena. Thye come from a set of smaller subsystems. For example, this very folgezettel that I'm using right now to organize my notes is a simple system, but it grows more complex the more I work with it.

As a sort of condition for this: [[notes/1a1_complex-systems-emerge-from-simple-systems|All complex systems emerge from simple systems]].
