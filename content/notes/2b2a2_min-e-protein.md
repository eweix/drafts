MinE is a protein in the [[notes/2b2a2_min-system-self-organizing-regulatory-system|Min system]]. In the cytosol, it dimerizes with other cytosolic MinE. When it detects membrane-bound [[notes/2b2a1_min-d-protein|MinD]], it binds to it and stimulates MinD's ATPase function. Once MinD falls off the membrane, MinE can either "roll" along the membrane to stimulate more MinD or it can return to the cytosol to start the cycle anew.
