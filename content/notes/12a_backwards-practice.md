When approaching a difficult excerpt or passage in music, instinct tells us to practice it over and over again from start to finish. While this works okay, it gives us a bias towards being very good at the beginning of a passage and less good at the end of a passage. To combat this, consider practicing things backwards.

Start at the end of a passageâ€”know where you have to land, how you want it to sound. Then work backwards and keep in mind how you set yourself up for that. Do a single measure (at most) at a time. [[notes/12c_slow-fast-practice|Practice slow, then fast]]. Then connect it up with the parts after it. This way you get very good at the end of the passage, and it becomes easier to stick the landing. Further difficulties can be ironed out through repetition.
