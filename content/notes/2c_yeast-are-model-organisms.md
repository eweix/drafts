Yeast are model organisms in microbiology, since they are so well-characterized. Many strains exist ([[notes/2c2_saccharomyces-cerevisiae|Saccharomyces cerevisiae]] being one of the most well-known) and fulfill a variety of use cases. Yeast also have many [[notes/2d_synthetic-biology|synthetic biology]] tools developed and available, including the [[notes/2c1_yeast-toolkit|MoClo kit]].
