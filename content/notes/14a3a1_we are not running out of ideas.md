We are not running out of ideas. If you look at all of the research and knowledge we've accumulated over the past millennium, it's tempting to say that all of the easy things have been doneâ€”it's only getting harder from here. That's neither true nor interesting. There are a lot of ideas left for us, and each problem that we solve opens up new questions and avenues for exploration. New tools let us answer old questions.

Be prolific when you come up with ideas. Make a lot of pitches. Don't be afraid to fail.

> The way I see it, if you want to write a song the world hasn't heard before, you have two choices. You can spend your time calculating how there's only a finite amount of different melodies, so eventually humans will run out of songs to write, so why bother. Or you can pick up a guitar and _play_.[^1]
