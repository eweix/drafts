Problems [[notes/14_goals-focus-effort|goals focus effort]]â€”in this case, solving the problem or responding to it in some way.

In the context of problems, consider that there are both [[notes/14a3_strong-link-problems-maximize-positive-outliers|strong-link problems]] and [[notes/14a2_weak-link-problems-minimize-negative-outliers|weak-link problems]]. These different types of problems should be approached in different ways. Other problems may not fall into these categories.

I like to keep a list of [[notes/14a1_my-favorite-problems|favorite problems]] to think about whenever I'm reading, writing, or in general existing. These give me a few directions that I can go in whenever I do stuff. It gives me focus when I search for something online or go down wikipedia rabbit holes.
