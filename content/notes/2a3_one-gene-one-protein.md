Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is the most important molecule in [[notes/2a3_one-gene-one-protein|genetics]]. It encodes the blueprint for making an organism, directly determining physiology. Small mutations in DNA that build up over time are responsible for the genetic changes wrought in [[notes/2e_evolution|evolution]].

One of the biggest breakthroughs in understanding the interplay between DNA and life was the "one gene, one protein" explanation. This eventually led to the [[notes/2a3a_operon-model|operon model]], which in turn revolutionized genetics. 

Genetics is a part of [[notes/2_biology-is-the-study-of-life|biology]] that focuses on studying genetic material and its consequences, such as [[notes/2e_evolution|evolution]].
