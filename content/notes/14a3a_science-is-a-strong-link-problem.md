Science is a [[notes/14a3_strong-link-problems-maximize-positive-outliers|strong-link problem]].[^1] It works by encouraging more outstanding results and positive outliers. That means we're better off with more people doing science.[^2] 

And [[14a3a1_we are not running out of ideas|we are not running out of ideas]]. There's a lot left for us to study, and every discovery begets new discoveries.

[^1]: See *[Science is a strong-link problem](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/science-is-a-strong-link-problem)* for more on this. Modern science is demanding.
[^2]: See *[An invitation to a secret society](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/an-invitation-to-a-secret-society)* for more on this and what everyone can do, regardless of training. Career science has its place (I mean, it's what I want to do!), but just because you don't have a degree doesn't mean you can't run experiments. Just be sure to do it without breaking laws.
