MinD a protein in the [[notes/2b2a2_min-system-self-organizing-regulatory-system|Min system]]. In the cytosol, it binds ATP and attaches to the cell membrane. There, [[notes/2b2a2_min-e-protein|MinE]] attaches to it and triggers MinD's ATPase function. MinD hydrolizes bound ATP, changes conformation, and returns to the cytosol to start the cycle anew.
