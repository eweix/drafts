Research and writing are two sides of the same coin.[^1] Both require [[notes/15a_writing-well-takes-time|time]], clear understanding, and seek to communicate information. They rely on [[notes/15c_the-key-to-credibility-is-specificity|write about what you know]], and writing it well.

In my experience, writing a good essay and troubleshooting a problem in the lab give me the same type of satisfaction.
