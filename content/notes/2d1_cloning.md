When you hear "cloning," you might think of Dolly the sheep[^1] or the Star Wars prequels. But in [[notes/2_biology-is-the-study-of-life|biology]], cloning usually refers to [[DNA replication]] and gene expression for experiments.

A cloning workflow might look something like this:
1. Design a peptide of interest *in silico* and gather source DNA.
2. PCR source DNA to replicate the bits that express target proteins.
3. Take target DNA sequences and put them into an expression vector.
4. Transform expression vector into bacteria. Plate it. Pick a few colonies to make overnight cultures.
5. Culture the cells, lyse them, and purify replicated expression vector.
6. Send expression vector for sequencing. If it matches up with the *in silico* design, then it is ready for cloning. Otherwise, pick new colonies and try again.

You may have already guessed that [[notes/2d1a_cloning-is-the-bottleneck-of-synthetic-biology|cloning is the bottleneck of synthetic biology]].
