[[notes/7_what-is-math|Math]] proofs are a sort of self-contained thought experiment. These logical proofs do not require data or experimentation; they only require a line of reasoning. Once proven, a theorem remains that way forever (unless faulty logic is used). This is different from the sciences, where older science may be corrected or disproven entirely.

This is the main characteristic that sets math apart from the sciences. [[notes/7a_math-is-a-humanities|Math is a humanities]], closer to logic and philosophy. It is still used commonly in the natural sciences to describe scientific hypotheses.
