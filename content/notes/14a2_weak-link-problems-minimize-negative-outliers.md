Weak-link problems describe situations where worth is determined by the worst results. Contrast these with [[notes/14a3_strong-link-problems-maximize-positive-outliers|strong-link problems]], which work by maximizing positive outliers rather than curtailing negative outliers.

Examples of weak-link problems include:
- Pharmaceuticals are carefully studied in clinical trials before being approved for use. This way we prevent potentially harmful drugs from going to market, but it extends the time needed to get them set up for public use.
- Food is also regulated by the FDA, and has [limits on the amount of insect contamination that is allowed](https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredients-additives-gras-packaging-guidance-documents-regulatory-information/food-defect-levels-handbook#commodities). In this case, we want those limits to be very low, so we have regulations that prevent the worst from getting on our shelves.

With weak-link problems, the [[notes/14_goals-focus-effort|goals]] should be to set up quality checks and lower-bounds for acceptability, which helps to remove negative outliers. However, this can also discourage or limit participation, thus reducing the total pool of results.[^1]
