The writing that stands out most is that which draws on deeply personal experiences.[^1] It is writing that cannot be made from a simple formula. You must know it well to write it, and that takes both time and expertise.

- A chemist can write well about chemistry and has unique insights on it because they have spent years and years doing experiments, generating data, and drawing conclusions with their mind.
- A historian can write well about their particular field of history because they have spent years combing over primary sources and figuring out things from those.
- A composer can write well about composition and music because they do have spent so much time composing songs and think about chords and keys.

> The authority of the journalist originates in this kind of claim: “I’m there, you’re not, let me tell you about it.” Or: “I reviewed those documents, you couldn’t—you were too busy trying to pay the mortgage—so let me tell you what they show.” Or: “We interviewed the workers who were on that drilling platform when it exploded, you didn’t, let us tell you their story.”
