Too often when we build things, we seek to impose some imagined order from the top downwards. We conceive a blueprint on paper, following some rules we have learned, and try to optimize the building. But buildings do not need to be optimized—it removes the nameless quality from them.

Do not make buildings modular—it destroys the soul of the building and makes it feel dead.
