Strong-link problems describe situations where worth is determined by the best results. Contrast these with [[notes/14c_weak-link-problems-minimize-negative-outliers|weak-link problems]], which work by curtailing negative outliers rather than maximizing positive ones.

Examples of strong-link problems include:
- Youtube videos. The best stuff goes viral and entertains a lot of people, but most of it just sits there with very small audiences.
- Science. The best papers can change entire fields or revolutionize an industry, while the less exciting papers don't usually cause us problems. [[notes/14b1_science-is-a-strong-link-problem|Science benefits from more scientists and more research]].
- Books. If someone writes a bad book, it just doesn't get bought. But again, the best books bring a lot of joy to people.

In strong link problems, generally the [[notes/14_goals-focus-effort|goal]] should be expanding the number of results to encourage more positive outliers, and providing people with tools to produce those positive outliers.
