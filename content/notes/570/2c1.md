Developed by Jacob and Monod, the operon describes methods of gene regulation and control. These genetic circuits help to produce varying phenotypes. Operons behave like a biological logic circuit, and can be thought of as something similar to logic gates or operators in programming.

The genetic circuits described by the operon model are the foundation of modern [[notes/570/8|synthetic biology]].
