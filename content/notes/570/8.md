Synthetic biology is a field of science that focuses on creating biological systems for fun and profit. It is closely intertwined with [[notes/570/_index|biology]] and [[notes/570/576|genetics]], and particularly the [[notes/570/2c1|operon model]] (which is the basis of synthetic genetic circuits).

Hallmark examples of synthetic biology include:
- Engineering organisms to produce a specific material or substance (ex: insulin can be made using recombinant sunflowers[^insulin-production])
- Creating organisms that can detect and respond to certain stimuli (ex: using modified bacteria to probe microorganism communities in soil)
- Generally finding ways to control the behaviors/functions of organisms
