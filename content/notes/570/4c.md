Yeast have three primary types of [[notes/570/4c|expression vectors]]: integrating plasmids, cen-ARS plasmids, and 2-micron plasmids. Genes of interest must be cloned into these for yeast experimentation.

## Integrating Plasmids
These are integrated directly into the yeast genome. You have to digest these and make a cut in the yeast's DNA to integrate it. This allows incredibly tight control over gene expression levels, as but a single copy of the DNA is integrated into each organism.

## Cen-ARS Plasmids
Centromere Autonomous Replicating Sequence. These have low copy numbers, and therefore a low spread in gene expression levels.

## 2-Micron Plasmids
2micron plasmids have a "greedy" origin of replication. This gives them a high copy number, leading to a high range of genetic expression levels. This is useful when trying to test a large sample space.
