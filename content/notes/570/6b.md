The bacterial Min [[notes/570/6|reaction-diffusion system]] is a regulatory system in certain bacteria that helps them to dynamically determine the center of the cell for placement of the division plane. Reactions between proteins [[notes/570/6b1|MinD]] and [[notes/570/6b2|MinE]] produce pole-to-pole oscillations that carry regulatory proteins, such as MinC, that inhibit z-ring formation or perform other functions.

Because it uses reaction diffusion mechanics, it does not rely on other cell structures. Instead, the Min system operates independently of the nucleoid! It is a type of cellular regulation that depends only on the
