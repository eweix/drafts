*Omnis cellula e cellula*. All cells come from cells. Such states cell theory, one of the key ideas in biology.

Cells are the atomic units of life. When you group many of them together, you get organisms through [[notes/500/1|emergence]] (consider that [[notes/570/1b|Life is an emergent phenomenon]]).[[notes/570/3b|all living phenomena can be understood through cells]].
