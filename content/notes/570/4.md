Yeast are model organisms in microbiology, since they are so well-characterized. Many strains exist ([[notes/570/4b|Saccharomyces cerevisiae]] being one of the most well-known) and fulfill a variety of use cases. Yeast also have many [[notes/570/8|synthetic biology]] tools developed and available, including the [[notes/570/4a|MoClo kit]].
