[[notes/570/8|Synthetic biology]] relies largely on gene cloning to test various [[notes/570/2c1|genetic circuits]] *in vivo*. Depending on cloning strategies, it can take anywhere from several days to several weeks to get from design to data. Since [[notes/000/10|addressing bottlenecks is the best way to improve efficiency]], there are several strategies to deal with this.

## Tools
- The [[notes/570/4a|MoClo yeast kit]] uses [[Golden Gate Cloning]] to improve iteration and combinatorial variation by building out a library of parts that can rapidly be assembled into functional constructs, with practically non-existent error rates.
- Diagnostic digest vs sequencing - sequencing is more accurate, but digests only take ~1 hour to produce results.
- Colony PCR - very fast and cheap for lots of constructs, but requires specific primer placement and planning.
