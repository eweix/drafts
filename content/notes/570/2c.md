Deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is the most important molecule in [[notes/570/576|genetics]]. It encodes the blueprint for making an organism, directly determining physiology. Small mutations in DNA that build up over time are responsible for the genetic changes wrought in [[notes/570/11|evolution]].

One of the biggest breakthroughs in understanding the interplay between DNA and life was the "one gene, one protein" explanation. This eventually led to the [[notes/570/2c1|operon model]], which in turn revolutionized genetics.
