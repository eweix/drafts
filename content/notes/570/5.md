Biochemistry is the intersection of [[notes/570/_index|biology]] and [[notes/540/_index|chemistry]]. It covers stuff from residues on protein structures to protein-protein interaction and all sorts of neat things. 

Because biochemistry studies the interaction between the smallest bits of matter that make sense in a living organism, you get to see the [[notes/570/1b|emergent phenomenon of life]] up close though biochem. It's like a language of life, and the proteins are the words.

One particular interaction studied in biochemistry is the [[notes/570/6|reaction-diffusion system]].
