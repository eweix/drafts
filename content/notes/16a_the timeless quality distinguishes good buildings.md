All good buildings (and many other good works of design) share the same timeless (and nameless) quality. Think of the moments in your life where everything just felt "right." That is the timeless quality. To achieve this quality, we must understand the event patterns that will shape the character of the building, and then we must build with spacial patterns that invite these events.
