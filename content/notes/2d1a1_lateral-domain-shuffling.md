Typical protein-based design strategies rely on breaking a protein down into individual domains. Modular domains can then be used to design new constructs and networks. This is called [[notes/2d1a_protein-domain-shuffling|domain shuffling]] (and this is specifically *lateral* domain shuffling, since it goes between proteins).

For example, you could take sensor domain from a protein and attach it to something else, or swap around the domain that starts signal transduction. You could end up changing the stimuli or response to it, and thus influence overall cell dynamics!

The difficulty with this strategy is that you never know quite what you're going to get from your new constructs. Removing one domain might ruin the protein folding and then break your whole peptide chain!
