The bacterial Min [[notes/572a|reaction-diffusion system]] is a regulatory system in certain bacteria that helps them to dynamically determine the center of the cell for placement of the division plane. Reactions between proteins [[synbio/574a1|MinD]] and [[synbio/574a2|MinE]] produce pole-to-pole oscillations that carry regulatory proteins, such as MinC, that inhibit z-ring formation or perform other functions.
