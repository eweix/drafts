Protein domain shuffling is a [[notes/574b|cloning technique]] used in [[notes/574|synthetic biology]] design. It usually focuses on shuffling around functional domains of a protein to try to create new chimeric proteins that fulfill a particular use case.

The two standard ideas in domain shuffling are [[notes/574c1|lateral domain shuffling]] and [[notes/574c|circular permutation]].
