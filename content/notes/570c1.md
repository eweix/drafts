Yeast are model organisms in [[notes/570c|microbiology]], since they are so well-characterized. Many strains exist ([[notes/570c1a|Saccharomyces cerevisiae]] being one of the most well-known) and fulfill a variety of use cases. Yeast also have many [[notes/574|synthetic biology]] tools developed and available, including the [[notes/574b1|MoClo kit]].
