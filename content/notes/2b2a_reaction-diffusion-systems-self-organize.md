Reaction diffusion systems are a type of interaction between particles that can be described as both [[notes/3a_chemical-reactions|chemical reactions]] and diffusion. [[notes/2b2b_phase-separation|Liquid-liquid phase separation]] also adds an additional dimension to the reaction-diffusion system, as many types of patterns also have a sort of phase-separating component.

The [[notes/2b2a1_gray-scott-rd-model|gray-scott model]] is a widely-used reaction-diffusion model.

There are a variety of different playgrounds that illustrate reaction-diffusion patterns. These are great for developing an intuitive understanding of the mechanisms for these systems.
