Patterns are made of spaces and events. These cannot be separated from one another. Space gives rise to events, and events give context to space. These are the basic elements that repeat in a pattern. [[notes/16a1_the world is made of patterns|This is constant across the world]].

Patterns can also be thought of like morpholoical laws: $X \to r(A,B, \dots)$ where in context $X$, parts $A,B, \dots$ are related by relationship $R$.
