The alternative approach to domain shuffling is to reuse domains from the same protein, but in a different order. While this is much more difficult to do well than lateral domain shuffling, it can produce very interesting results (like circular fluorescent proteins[^circular-gfp]).

It's called circular permutation because you put the end of the protein at the front, typically.
