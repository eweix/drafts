Biochemistry is the intersection of [[notes/2_biology-is-the-study-of-life|biology]] and [[notes/3_chemistry-is-the-study-of-matter|chemistry]]. It covers stuff from residues on protein structures to protein-protein interaction and all sorts of neat things. 

Because biochemistry studies the interaction between the smallest bits of matter that make sense in a living organism, you get to see the [[notes/1b_life-is-emergent|emergent phenomenon of life]] up close though biochem. It's like a language of life, and the proteins are the words.

One particular interaction studied in biochemistry is the [[notes/2b2a_reaction-diffusion-systems-self-organize|reaction-diffusion system]].
