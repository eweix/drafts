The central dogma of [[notes/570|biology]] is that [[notes/576b|DNA]] is [[notes/570a1|transcribed]] into RNA, which is then [[notes/570a2|translated]] into amino acid chains that make proteins. Those proteins then assist in all sorts of cellular functions, including making more DNA. This is the cycle of life on the cellular level.
