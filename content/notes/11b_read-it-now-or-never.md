I stopped using my link inbox some time ago. Every time I use it, I run into the same problem: I funnel too many things into it and I don't want to let go of any of them. The cognitive load is taxing (defeating the very purpose of an inbox).

Read it now or read it never is a practice around consuming information. If you really find something interesting, go ahead and read it right now. Look it up, open that article, read it, take notes if you dare. But do it now. If you choose not to read it, then don't save it anywhere. It didn't matter enough for you to do that.

The idea with this is that there's only so much time and there's too many good things to read. There's not much of a point in wasting time on things that aren't *that* interesting if you have a choice.
