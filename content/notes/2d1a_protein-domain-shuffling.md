Protein domain shuffling is a [[notes/2d1a_cloning-is-the-bottleneck-of-synthetic-biology|cloning technique]] used in [[notes/2d_synthetic-biology|synthetic biology]] design. It usually focuses on shuffling around functional domains of a protein to try to create new chimeric proteins that fulfill a particular use case.

The two standard ideas in domain shuffling are [[notes/2d1a1_lateral-domain-shuffling|lateral domain shuffling]] and [[notes/2d1a_protein-domain-shuffling|circular permutation]].
