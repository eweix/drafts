Protein domain shuffling is a [[notes/2d1a_cloning-is-the-bottleneck-of-synthetic-biology|cloning technique]] used in [[notes/2d_synthetic-biology|synthetic biology]] design. It usually focuses on shuffling around functional domains of a protein to try to create new chimeric proteins that fulfill a particular use case.

The two standard ideas in domain shuffling are [[notes/2d1a1_lateral-domain-shuffling|lateral domain shuffling]] and [[notes/2d1a_protein-domain-shuffling|circular permutation]].

Since moving around units in a peptide chain can drastically alter how it folds, tools like [[docs/alphafold|alphafold]] and [[docs/pymol|pymol]] are helpful for making more intentional cuts and predicting how shuffling will change the structure of the protein.
