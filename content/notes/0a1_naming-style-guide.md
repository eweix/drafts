Names are important! Especially when it comes to files and organization. Taking a little bit of time to establish a consistent syntax/style for naming makes it much easier to find things when you look for them later.[^1]

- Use `"_"` underscores to delimit *units of meta-data* in a project
- Use "-" hyphens to delimit *words* (basically replace spaces with these)

When I make presentations or write essays, I name files like this:

```
YYYY-MM-DD_author-initials_project-name-here.extension
```

And for notes using a [[notes/11a_folgezettel-zettelkasten|zettel style]] and Luhmann IDs, I name things as such:

```
ID_example-note-name.md
```

For books:

```
authorlastname_book-title.md
```

It is not the most consistent, but it works fairly well for me.
