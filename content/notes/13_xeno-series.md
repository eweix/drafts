The Xeno- series (also sometimes called the Perfect Works saga) is a set of videogames that starts with Xenogears (1998). I've only played the Xenoblade Chronicles games and the relevant DLC. These games contain a lot of themes inspired by Jungian psychology, gnosticism, existentialism, and some other pretty heavy philosophy. But mostly they're fantastic JRPGs.

A two and a half hour video essay on xenoblade chronicles. It's a fantastic summary of the series. I cannot in good conscience recommend this video for the same reason I cannot in good conscience recommend xenoblade chronicles or anything in the Perfect Works saga: it's too great a time sink anyone with a job. I only managed to beat Xenoblade 3 and Future Redeemed by spending gratuitous amounts of time on the couch during the summer.
