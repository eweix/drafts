The idea is to get the most out of the least work. The eighty-twenty rule suggests that [[twenty percent of the effort gets you eighty percent of the results]]. Certain limitations stop you from getting more than that. By focusing on improving the bottlenecks in a system, you can get to the point where you can do more with the same amount of effort.

For example, when I'm writing, my main bottleneck in writing is putting the first words on the page. To get around that, I do things like writing sprints to force myself to spit out a rough draft without trying to polish up my work.
