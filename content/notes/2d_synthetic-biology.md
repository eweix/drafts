Synthetic biology is a field of science that focuses on creating biological systems for fun and profit. It is closely intertwined with [[notes/2_biology-is-the-study-of-life|biology]] and [[notes/2a3_one-gene-one-protein|genetics]], and particularly the [[notes/2a3a_operon-model|operon model]] (which is the basis of synthetic genetic circuits).

Hallmark examples of synthetic biology include:
- Engineering organisms to produce a specific material or substance (ex: insulin can be made using recombinant sunflowers[^1])
- Creating organisms that can detect and respond to certain stimuli (ex: using modified bacteria to probe microorganism communities in soil)
- Generally finding ways to control the behaviors/functions of organisms

A main method of studying [[notes/2a3a_operon-model|genetic circuits]] in synthetic biology is through [[2d1_cloning|cloning]]
