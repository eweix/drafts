[[notes/7a_math-is-a-humanities|Math is a humanities subject]]. It is the study of numbers. It also might not be real. Some 2000 years ago, Plato the philosopher proposed that math revealed a sort of hidden reality of the worldâ€”a universal ideal a layer below what our experience.[^1]

Math has been unreasonably effective[^2] in describing the world through the natural sciences, expressing laws in [[notes/9_physics|physics]], modeling [[notes/2b2a_reaction-diffusion-systems-self-organize|reaction-diffusion systems]] in [[notes/4_biochemistry-is-the-language-of-life|biochemistry]], and calculating interest rates in economics.

Was math invented or was it discovered?
