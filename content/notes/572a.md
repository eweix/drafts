Reaction diffusion systems are a type of interaction between particles that can be described as both [[notes/540a|chemical reactions]] and diffusion. [[notes/572b|Liquid-liquid phase separation]] also adds an additional dimension to the reaction-diffusion system, as many types of patterns also have a sort of phase-separating component.
