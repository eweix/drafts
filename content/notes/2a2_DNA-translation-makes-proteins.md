[[notes/2a1_DNA-transcription|DNA is transcribed into RNA]] using transcriptase in the nucleus of the cell. That RNA is then interpreted by ribosomes. Each triplet codon of the RNA translates to a specific amino acid, which is linked onto an ever-growing chain by a peptide bond. This makes proteins.

This is a key part of the [[notes/2a_central-dogma-of-biology|central dogma]] of biology.
