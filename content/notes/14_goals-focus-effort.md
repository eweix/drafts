Goals give our effort context and focus. They define an end and direct our actions to that end. If we don't have goals, then we have no stopping points. And we also have no metric for success. [[Things can only be understood in context]].

A useful thing to do in research is to define a goal using questions. Answering that question means you have met your goal there. It does not mean the end of your workâ€”often, answers to these questions give way to more interesting questions, and thus the cycle continues. Sometimes these goals are also called "problems" to frame them as something that you want to solve. Either one works well. In the context of problems, consider that there are both [[notes/14b_strong-link-problems-maximize-positive-outliers|strong-link problems]] and [[notes/14c_weak-link-problems-minimize-negative-outliers|weak-link problems]]

I like to keep a list of [[notes/14a_my-favorite-problems|favorite problems]] to think about whenever I'm reading, writing, or in general existing. These give me a few directions that I can go in whenever I do stuff. It gives me focus when I search for something online or go down wikipedia rabbit holes.
