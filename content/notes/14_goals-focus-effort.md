Goals give our effort context and focus. They define an end and direct our actions to that end. If we don't have goals, then we have no stopping points. And we also have no metric for success. [[Things can only be understood in context]].

A useful thing to do in research is to define a goal using questions. Answering that question means you have met your goal there. It does not mean the end of your workâ€”often, answers to these questions give way to more interesting questions, and thus the cycle continues.
