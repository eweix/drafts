- Be honest about what you know
- Fact check your work (and correct it)
- Be positive
- Stick to your own experience
- Talk about things while they're fresh in your mind
- It's okay if not everyone likes it

- Just read this whole post though. It's fantastic.
- You don't have to be original
- You don't need to be an expert
- Page views don't matter (also analytics suck for the record)
- Blogging is not for everyone (and also, the coporatized "personal brand" is kinda odious)

- if you talk about facts, you will receive facts
- stories are great
- ask technical questions
- ask for examples and experiences, not opinions (what are people's experiences with writing online, for example?)
- start with a little context
- set boundaries
- pre-empt common suggestions
