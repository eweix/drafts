think I have a new favorite book.\n\nBecky Chambers's *A Psalm for the Wild-Built* is a beautiful book about a tea-brewing therapist in a post-cataclysm world going on a road trip with a robot.\nChambers's vivid prose brings to life a story about friendship, agency, and personal purpose.\n\nThe setting falls squarely in what my family and I lovingly call \"[Ghibli apocalypse](https://www.ghibli.jp/gallery/nausicaa002.jpg).\" Humanity has changed deeply, giving way to the natural world.\nIn this case, robots spontaneously gained consciousness and rejected their human-given purpose of servitude.\nContrary to the fictional trope of robot rebellion, humans assisted the robots in their liberation and ceded part of the world to them.\nThe world is barely recognizable—humans have learned to live in harmony with nature, satisfied without the exponential growth that we have come to expect.\nI love this setting because of its innate hope and its vision of a world beyond ours.\n\nThe story centers around a tea-monk named Dex—they are a sort of therapist/herbalist, who listens to people and gives them tea.\nTheir profession is framed as a way of helping people find comfort in their existence, whether it's about learning to grieve or relaxing for a moment.\nIt's a sweet concept, and it characterizes the hope in this story.\n\nThere's also touches of [absurdism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism) in this story.\nI haven't read many works of fiction featuring this philosophy (the only other one is [Kill Six Billion Demons](https://killsixbilliondemons.com/comic/kill-six-billion-demons-chapter-1/)), but the core message shines here.\nIt's more powerful if you sit down and read the book for yourself.\nIt's stubbornly hopeful and rejects purpose, so it's right up my alley.\n\nThe most fantastic thing in this book is not robots who have gained consciousness, but the fact that their computers are made to last a lifetime.\nAh, to imagine a world without planned obsolescence and easy repair.","lastmodified":"2023-08-25T17:23:16.965791205Z","tags":[]},"/books/christie_after-the-funeral":{"title":"After

like a self-help book, but it isn't.\nJohann Hari takes a systems-first approach to understanding distraction, rather than centering the individual.\nHari's thesis is that our shrinking attention spans are not our fault.\nInstead, they are the direct result of conscious decisions by tech companies—companies whose profits depend on holding our focus as long as possible.\nYour distraction isn't your fault, says Hari.\n\nI think this book is worth reading.\nIf you want to get the most out of this in a single chapter, I recommend chapter 8: Cruel Optimism.\nThis is where the book really came together for me.\nHere, [Hari argues with Nir Eyal](https://stolenfocusbook.com/audio/), author of *Indistractable* (which is a self-help book) over the solutions to overwhelming distraction.\nEyal advocates the individual approach (turn off your phone, walk outside, rigorously schedule things, etc.) while Hari proposes designing humane technology that assists us in disconnecting.\nHari described a feeling that I've been having trouble articulating: so much of the individual approach is based on exceptionalism and privilege.\nI did it, so you can too—except that I can work remotely, and I don't have to worry about food and job security, and I'm not taking care of four kids by myself.\nBootstrapping is toxic.\n\nThis book makes me all the more certain that removing the feed-style

on your life as much as possible.\nIt's not malicious or personal, it's business.\nBut the cost of business is enormous.\n\nThere's a lot of other things covered in this *Stolen Focus*—from the way we let our minds wander to the four day work-week, but I think they're all best explained by reading the book.\nI recommend it.\nIt starts off like a self-help book, and I understand if that turns you off.\nBut Johann Hari has penned a solid critique of the current state of technology, and how we can move forward from it.","lastmodified":"2023-08-25T17:23:16.969791273Z","tags":[]},"/books/hedges_empire-of-illusion":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"---\ntitle: \"Empire of Illusion\"\naliases:\n  - Empire of

wrote *Empire of Illusion* during 2009, during the middle of an economic recession. Near the midway point of Obama's second term. After looking up some reviews, I saw it described as a [jeremiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiad) - a lament about the downfall of society. I'd say that's an accurate description.\n\n## Summary\nIn *Empire of Illusion*, Chris Hedges describes the United States as a declining culture—our hearts and minds captured by artifice, our education dictated by corporations, and our politics increasingly privatized. We have bought into a false reality, Hedges argues.  Hedges alludes to Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World*, discussing a society controlled not by pain, but by pleasure—a world destroyed by \"what we love.\" Unless we face reality and pull the wool from our eyes, we will forever remain under the thumb of exploitative corporations, and the U. S. will fall into disarray.\n\n## Notes\n- I do disagree with Hedges on academics, though when he writes \"academic\" he seems to mean \"economist\" half of the time.\n\n### Artifice\n\u003e \"The most essential skill in political theater and a consumer culture is artifice. Political leaders, ==who use the tools of mass propaganda to create a sense of faux intimacy with citizens==, no longer need to be competent, sincere, or honest. They need only appear to have these qualities. Most importantly, ==they need a story, a personal narrative.== The reality of the narrative is irrelevant. It can be completely at odds with the facts. The consistency and emotional appeal of the story are paramount. Those who are best at deception succeed. Those who who have not mastered the art of entertainment, who fail to create a narrative or do not have one fashioned for them by their handlers, are ignored. They become 'unreal.'\"\n\u003e \n\u003e —\u003ccite\u003eChris Hedges\u003c/cite\u003e\n\nArtifice is the skill of faux intimimacy. Through manufactured events and stories, politicians, CEOS, and others build false connections with their audience. Controlling the emotions of others becomes the goal, rather than appealing to their needs or treating them as intelligent thinking beings.\n\n### Jargon as a means of exclusion\nConsider accessible and inaccessible language. Hedges refers to most technical terms in academics as inaccessible (though see note on economists), and seems to claim that academics \"retreat\" into the language of their field to avoid explaining or engaging in honest conversation. I disagree with this on the basis that I have spoken a lot of scientists in the life sciences and physical sciences, and all of them are very enthusiastic about talking about their work. It's not a conscious decision to exclude people; at worst, I would say it's the curse of knowledge. Once you know certain things about a subject, it's hard to think about what it would be like not to know those things, and your explanations reflect that.\n\nAll that aside, jargon does exclude people (intentionally or not). Hedges likens these difficultues in communication to sectorial languages, as if we have been cursed with fragmented communication after building a tower of babel.\n\n### Corporate education\nHedges argues that our colleges and universities are no longer truly places of higher education. Instead, they have pivoted to the goal of vocational training and certification. We focus on teaching memorization and regurgitation, not synthesis or true composition. This gets back to the typical thing I hear about liberal arts educations, and how we no longer value training people to think.[^1] I take this with a grain of salt.[^2]\n\n[^1]: Hedges bases his argument mainly on the rise of for-profit universities (which arguably shouldn't be a thing) and corporate donations that sustain universities. [The percentage has hovered at above 65% since the early 2000s](https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/college-enrollment-statistics/),  though it dropped a bit during the pandemic.\n[^2]: That being said, I love the liberal arts. I had a lot of fun with my literature and government classes, and I've come to appreciate history. Without this sort of education, I never would have discovered my love of writing or music.","lastmodified":"2023-08-25T17:23:16.969791273Z","tags":[]},"/books/kendall_hood-feminism":{"title":"Hood Feminism","content":"*Hood Feminism* is a collection of essays about feminism, racism, poverty, and change.\nEach essay focuses on a different issue: hunger, racist beauty standards, the systemic exclusion of non-white needs from mainstream feminism, and other topics.\nKendall's arguments are thoughtful and passionate, fueled by righteous anger.\n\nMikki Kendall's *Hood Feminism* is a must-read for anyone interested in understanding the intersections of feminism and other social liberation movements.\nIf you read this book and end up liking, it, also consider reading *Care Work* by Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha.\nPhenomenal book about disability justice.","lastmodified":"2023-08-25T17:23:16.969791273Z","tags":[]},"/books/melville_moby-dick":{"title":"Moby Dick","content":"Full disclosure: everything I knew about *Moby Dick* before reading this novel came from [*Bone* by Jeff Smith](https://www.boneville.com/).\nI did not know what I was in for.\n\nHerman Melville's *Moby Dick* is a strange book.\nThe first fifteen or so pages are filled with nothing but quotes about whales from all sorts of texts, from the bible to the writings of Pliny the Elder.\nI had no idea what I was getting into when I started reading it, save that it was long and dense.\nSome number of hours of victorian prose about whales later, I'm done.\n\n*Moby Dick* moves at a ponderous pace.\nMelville lingers on the details of whaling and butchering, and deigns to spend whole pages on Ishmael extolling the virtures of whalers.\nThe details are rich, similar to Robert Jordan's writing in *The Wheel of Time*, and it's just as dense.\nAlmost all of the action happens in the final hundred pages of the book.\nBut the four hundred or so pages before the plot feel like a preamble, but I think that I also wasn't reading closely enough.\nThe next time I go through this book, I'll read it slower.\n\nUnfortunately, *Moby Dick* did not age all that well.\nMelville's plot doesn't hinge on racist stereotypes, but he sure does make use of them in his writing.\nSo.

Solomon is not an exception to that rule.\nLike in her other works, Morrison fills every sentence in *Song of Solomon* with nuance and symbolism.\nI read this book as part of one of my projects for a literature class, and ended up spending almost a week trying to make sense of it afterwards.\nIn other words: this book is *dense*.\nSometimes it demands rereading the same paragraph—or even the same sentence—multiple times to understand all the sigificance.\n\nIn the foreward of the book, Morrison offers an example:\n\u003e \"'The North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance agent promised to fly from Mercy to the other side of Lake Superior at 3:00.'\"\n\u003e \n\u003e \"… It has the tone of an everyday event of minimal local interest, yet I wanted it to contain important signs and crucial information.\nThe name of the insurance company is that of a well-known black-owned company dependent on black clients… The sentence starts with 'North Carolina' and closes with 'Lake Superior'—geographical locations that suggest a journey from South to North.\"\n\nAnd Morrison continues laying out the significance of every single word in that sentence for the rest of the page.\nWhile not every sentence is like this, many of them are.\nAnd each one builds on the others masterfully.\nThat's the style of writing you have here.\nSong of Solomon is a book you can sit down and read in an afternoon, but it invites you to spend so much more time considering it.\n\nMorrison's books deal with a lot of heavy themes, from racism to misogyny to familial abuse.\nHer characters, for all of their struggles, are unspeakably human, which can make it all the more painful to see them through their trials.\nI cried reading this book, and there were pages where I had to sit for a bit with the weight of the words before I could continue.\n\n*Song of Solomon* in particular is unique among Morrison's works in that it was a departure from the female-focus of her other works, centering instead around a man and his story.\nBut Morrison does not leave women behind in her book, instead describing the ways a woman's interactions with society change if a man leaves her behind, as well as revealing the double standards faced by women daily, hourly, constantly.\n\nI recommend this book.\nThere's a reason Morrison is one of the most celebrated authors in the literary canon.\nThis is my first time reading one of Morrison's books, and I'm eager for more.\nI might have to wait a bit before tackling another,

book.\nIt's made all the richer when you have modern context and a more academic or practical understanding of the content—I had a lot of fun learning about the origins of the lab procedures that I take for granted, like gene cloning and transfection.\n\nIf you hear the words \"gene\" or \"DNA\" and you don't quite know what it means, this book is a great place to start.\nMukherjee's style is very approachable while still allowing for a deep exploration of the book's topics.\nOne of my other favorite books, *[[books/mukherjee_the-song-of-the-cell|The Song of the Cell]]* (also by Siddharta Mukherjee) is written in much the same way.\n\n## Notes\n- [[notes/2a3_one-gene-one-protein|DNA]]\n- [[notes/2a_central-dogma-of-biology|central dogma]]\n-

Decades of systemic oppression by government agencies, public policy, and exploitative economic practices got us where we are today. Conscious decisions got us here, not unfortunate legacies.\n\n## Notes\n\n### The myth of *De facto* desgregation\n\u003e \"…remedies are inconceivable so long as citizens… continue to accept the myth of *de facto* segregation.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e —\u003ccite\u003eRichard Rothstein\u003c/cite\u003e\n\n*De facto* segregation (at least, as far as \"unintentional\" segregation as a consequence of slavery) is a myth. *De jure* segregation (that is, segregation by government policy) was and is the reality of segregation in the United States.\n\nAlthough racial disparities in income and assets are often fingered as the main reason for *de facto* segregation, these differences historically were caused by public policies: income suppression via excluding African-American-dominated industries from minimum wage and certain labor protections, for example. This is segregation *de jure*.\n\nIf we believe segregation to be incidental, then we fall into the trap of addressing it like an incidental problem. If we believe segregation is mostly the fault of misguided hearts and minds, then we risk addressing it as such. The only way to achieve racial integration and abolish segregation is with public policies as aggressive (or moreso) than those that caused it.\n\n### Housing is intrinsically tied to civil rights\nHousing is tied to civil rights. Without policies that protect housing rights for all, the US betrays the ideals of the Constitution.\n\n\u003e \"…You have no right to use housing against civil rights… Housing is advanced in the intent of the general welfare and the interest of strenghtening democracy. When you separate civil rights from housing you weaken that general welfare.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e —\u003ccite\u003eVito Marcantonio\u003c/cite\u003e\n\n### Racial zoning is used to enforce *de jure* segregation\nRacial zoning has two main parts:\n1. Keeping African Americans out of white neighborhoods by making it difficult for lower-income families to afford living there.\n2. Protecting white neighborhoods by directing industrial businesses or those that produce toxic waste away. These businesses then go to their alternative, which is often sites close to African-American neighborhoods.\n\nThis lowers property values near African-American neighborhoods but protects property values in white neighborhoods. Because these zonings are often protected or enforced by public policy, this makes it *de jure* segregation.\n\n### The FHA plays a role in *de jure segregation*\nThe Federal Housing Administration systematically denied financing and approval for projects designated for African-Americans, while approving those for whites (i.e. Levittown). The FHA also refused to approve mortgages and loans for African-Americans, denying African-Americans any form of financial support (even under the GI bill). Without the means, it became near-impossible to move into suburbs, which contributed heavily to segregated housing.\n\n### Restrictive covenants\nRestrictive covenants are terms on property deeds that restrict selling to certain groups. They are unconstitutional, unlawful, and utterly repugnant, but they were used to prevent homeowners in white developments from selling to African-American buyers who did have the means to afford those homes.\n\n### Local policies and tactics were used to enforce segregation\nTools such as zoning condemnation and city planning were used to segregate neighborhoods by either encouraging white flight or forcing African-Americans to move. School placement was key in city planning.\n\n### When all else failed, state-supported violence enforced segregation\nAfrican-Americans who dared try to integrate into white suburbs or other developments all faced the same response: vicious attacks by white supremecists. Police would stand idly by or even encourage angry mobs that attacked the homes of African-American families. District attorneys would refuse to prosecute the criminal acts, and higher-ups in the police forces would turn a blind eye. Because the State could reasonably be said to know that this would happen (given that the superiors of those involved were usually either aware or directly complicit), this could be called state-sanctioned violence.\n\nEven more galling is the fact that the State would sometimes retaliate against the targets of the violence, arresting them for \"disturbing the peace\" or \"unlawfully\" buying homes bound by restrictive covenants.","lastmodified":"2023-08-25T17:23:16.969791273Z","tags":[]},"/books/shehadeh_we-could-have-been-friends-my-father-and-i":{"title":"We Could Have Been

and in pop culture.\nAt the Renaissance Fair last year, I saw more than zero people dressed up as mushrooms.\nIn fact, I saw four or five people dressed up as mushrooms, which isn't that much, but it's odd considering that I usually see zero.\nFungi are fascinating things, though, and I understand a little more about why someone might want to dress up as one after reading this book.\nAlso, I can finally talk with my younger sibling about fungi and understand them.\n\n*Entangled Life* is a book about fungi.\nIt goes through all the motions you'd expect—psychedelics such as LSD, slime mold problem solving, and fermentation—and many that you wouldn't, from challenging our linear understanding of evolution to exploring enormous fungal networks in the woods.\nMerlin Sheldrake's writing is entertaining and clear—you do not need to be a mycologist to understand the book.\n\nSheldrake also expresses a lot of hope for present and future uses of fungi.\nFrom white rot fungi that can decompose toxic waste to mycelial leathers, there appears to be a fungal solution to all sorts of environmental and material issues.\nSome of the discussions on fungal upcycling and fungal materials (such as those used by [Ecovative](https://www.ecovative.com/) and [FUNGAR](https://www.fungar.eu/) remind me of the optimistic industrial views of *Cradle to Cradle*—a way to think of waste as food.\n\nHere's a list of some projects I found online about fungal projects:\n- [Press release regarding FUNGAR](https://mogu.bio/fungar-project-bbi-h2020-press-release/) (2020)\n- [The Plan to Mop

stood outside with him for like three hours in March heping him pressure cook grain for it.\nAfter reading this book, I have to say that I'm interested in doing that myself, though maybe without the pressure cooking.\nI think you can find easier ways online.\n\nBut enough rambling.\n\nMerlin Sheldrake's *Entangled Life* is a great book for anyone remotely interested in fungi.\nIt's a pretty short read, too—less then 250 pages.","lastmodified":"2023-08-25T17:23:16.969791273Z","tags":[]},"/books/skloot_the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks":{"title":"The Immortal Life of Henrietta

was made from her.\nIt's a bookfull of grief and frustration with a racist medical research industry.\nIt's a book about science and history.\nBut mostly, it's a book about the stubborn determination and resilience of the Lacks family.\nMuch of the book is in their own words.\n\nI first heard about this book from one of my classmates, who read it for an essay project in an English class.\nOnce I started working in a research lab and doing experiments in human cells, I felt is was important that I read it too.\nI've used [HEK293T cells](https://www.synthego.com/hek293), [3T3

the HeLa cell line—created using cells taken from Henrietta Lacks's cervical cancer tumor—was the first immortal cell line ever created, and paved the road for basically all of the tools of modern cell culture.\n\nGeorge Gey (pronounced like \"guy\")—the scientist who took Henrietta Lacks's cells—took them without informed consent.\nWhile this was legal, it certainly wasn't ethical.\nAlthough Gey never tried to patent HeLa cells or make money from them (in fact, he gave them out to every researcher he thought might find them useful, and refused to start a commercial cell culture firm), that doesn't what he did right.\nAnd other groups did make money off of the cells, including a firm that would later become [Invitrogen](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/brands/invitrogen.html) (a branch of the enormous Thermo-Fisher Scientific corporation).\nWe still don't have laws in place to fully prevent something like this from happening a second time.\nSkloot discusses ethics throughout the book, and moves onto the laws and conversations on patient rights in tissue sampling at the end of the book—it's a great read to the very end.\n\n*The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks*

Almost like blog posts, except that they're really a way to making something coherent things that are already on this website. These are revisited and revised sometimes, if I find new stuff that I think should be added.\n- The [reading list](/books) is a list of books I have read in chronological order. It's listed this way so I have a decent idea of when I read something (since I always forget). Each book has an individual page that may or may not contain information about it and notes that I've taken.\n- [Notes](/notes) are the meat of this website. These are smaller pages, usually under 300 words, and contain digested information about a lot of different topics. They're written for me, so they're not always the most comphrehensible.\n- [Recipes](/recipes) are self-explanatory.\n\n## How to read this website\nThis website is not laid out like a blog or a newsfeed. That's intentional. My latest writing is not necessarily my best writing. Instead of trying to find the most recently updated notes (though those are available at the [home page](/)), I encourage you to click through links and go down rabbit holes exploring stuff that interests you. And if you find something that you like, you can always bookmark it or copy it or save it for later somehow.\n\nI suggest paging through the collections, finding something that interests you, and then chasing the source notes for that around for a little bit.

The whole process to go from idea to usable construct can take a week or two, though it varies depending on what libraries you might have available and sequencing luck.\n\n## Tools\n- The [[notes/2c1_yeast-toolkit|MoClo yeast kit]] uses [[Golden Gate Cloning]] to improve iteration and combinatorial variation by building out a library of parts that can rapidly be assembled into functional constructs, with practically non-existent error rates.\n- Diagnostic digest vs sequencing - sequencing is more accurate, but digests only take ~1 hour to produce results.\n- Colony PCR - very fast and cheap for lots of constructs, but requires specific primer placement and planning.","lastmodified":"2023-08-25T17:23:16.973791342Z","tags":[]},"/notes/2d1a_protein-domain-shuffling":{"title":"Protein domain shuffling","content":"Protein domain shuffling is a [[notes/2d1a_cloning-is-the-bottleneck-of-synthetic-biology|cloning technique]] used in [[notes/2d_synthetic-biology|synthetic biology]] design.
