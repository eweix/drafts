robot.\nChambers's vivid prose brings to life a story about friendship, agency, and personal purpose.\n\n\u003c!--more--\u003e\n\nThe setting falls squarely in what my family and I lovingly call \"[Ghibli apocalypse](https://www.ghibli.jp/gallery/nausicaa002.jpg).\" Humanity has changed deeply, giving way to the natural world.\nIn this case, robots spontaneously gained consciousness and rejected their human-given purpose of servitude.\nContrary to the fictional trope of robot rebellion, humans assisted the robots in their liberation and ceded part of the world to them.\nThe world is barely recognizable—humans have learned to live in harmony with nature, satisfied without the exponential growth that we have come to expect.\nI love this setting because of its innate hope and its vision of a world beyond ours.\n\nThe story centers around a tea-monk named Dex—they are a sort of therapist/herbalist, who listens to people and gives them tea.\nTheir profession is framed as a way of helping people find comfort in their existence, whether it's about learning to grieve or relaxing for a moment.\nIt's a sweet concept, and it characterizes the hope in this story.\n\nThere's also touches of [absurdism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism) in this story.\nI haven't read many works of fiction featuring this philosophy (the only other one is [Kill Six Billion

like a self-help book, but it isn't.\nJohann Hari takes a systems-first approach to understanding distraction, rather than centering the individual.\nHari's thesis is that our shrinking attention spans are not our fault.\nInstead, they are the direct result of conscious decisions by tech companies—companies whose profits depend on holding our focus as long as possible.\nYour distraction isn't your fault, says Hari.\n\nI think this book is worth reading.\nIf you want to get the most out of this in a single chapter, I recommend chapter 8: Cruel Optimism.\nThis is where the book really came together for me.\nHere, [Hari argues with Nir Eyal](https://stolenfocusbook.com/audio/), author of *Indistractable* (which is a self-help book) over the solutions to overwhelming distraction.\nEyal advocates the individual approach (turn off your phone, walk outside, rigorously schedule things, etc.) while Hari proposes designing humane technology that assists us in disconnecting.\nHari described a feeling that I've been having trouble articulating: so much of the individual approach is based on exceptionalism and privilege.\nI did it, so you can too—except that I can work remotely, and I don't have to worry about food and job security, and I'm not taking care of four kids by myself.\nBootstrapping is toxic.\n\nThis book makes me all the more certain that removing the feed-style format of this website was the right choice.\nAt one point, one of my friends told me that I should have a sort of infinite feed to help \"draw people in.\" I thought about it and wrote up the code.\nBut then I previewed it and felt disgusted looking at it.\nIt wasn't a humane website design.\n[All good websites are finite](https://humanebydesign.com/principles/finite).\n\nHari also discusses and condemns [surveillance capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism): the practice of harvesting and selling personal data.[ This is how many companies make money](https://theconversation.com/if-its-free-online-you-are-the-product-95182), from Facebook to Google to TikTok.\nIf the service is free, then [you're not the customer—you're the product](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/doug-rushkoff-hello-etsy).\nI appreciate that Hari includes this, as this section helps to explain the reason that companies want to take your data and intrude on your life as much as possible.\nIt's not malicious or personal, it's business.\nBut the cost of business is enormous.\n\nThere's a lot of other things covered in this *Stolen Focus*—from the way we let our minds wander to the four day work-week, but I think they're all best explained by reading the book.\nI recommend it.\nIt starts off like a self-help book, and I understand if that turns you off.\nBut Johann Hari has penned a solid critique of the current state of technology, and how we can move forward from it.","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T01:10:10.074368139Z","tags":[]},"/books/kendall_hood-feminism":{"title":"Hood Feminism","content":"*Hood Feminism* is a collection of essays about feminism, racism,

this novel came from [*Bone* by Jeff Smith](https://www.boneville.com/).\nI did not know what I was in for.\n\nHerman Melville's *Moby Dick* is a strange book.\nThe first fifteen or so pages are filled with nothing but quotes about whales from all sorts of texts, from the bible to the writings of Pliny the Elder.\nI had no idea what I was getting into when I started reading it, save that it was long and dense.\nSome number of hours of victorian prose about whales later, I'm done.\n\n*Moby Dick* moves at a ponderous pace.\nMelville lingers on the details of whaling and butchering, and deigns to spend whole pages on Ishmael extolling the virtures of whalers.\nThe details are rich, similar to Robert Jordan's writing in *The Wheel of Time*, and it's just as dense.\nAlmost all of the action happens in the final hundred pages of the book.\nBut the four hundred or so pages before the plot feel like a preamble, but I think that I also wasn't reading closely enough.\nThe next time I go through this book, I'll read it slower.\n\nUnfortunately, *Moby Dick* did not age all that well.\nMelville's plot doesn't hinge on racist stereotypes, but he sure does make use of them in his

Solomon is not an exception to that rule.\nLike in her other works, Morrison fills every sentence in *Song of Solomon* with nuance and symbolism.\nI read this book as part of one of my projects for a literature class, and ended up spending almost a week trying to make sense of it afterwards.\nIn other words: this book is *dense*.\nSometimes it demands rereading the same paragraph—or even the same sentence—multiple times to understand all the sigificance.\n\nIn the foreward of the book, Morrison offers an example:\n\u003e \"'The North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance agent promised to fly from Mercy to the other side of Lake Superior at 3:00.'\"\n\u003e \n\u003e \"… It has the tone of an everyday event of minimal local interest, yet I wanted it to contain important signs and crucial information.\nThe name of the insurance company is that of a well-known black-owned company dependent on black clients… The sentence starts with 'North Carolina' and closes with 'Lake Superior'—geographical locations that suggest a journey from South to North.\"\n\nAnd Morrison continues laying out the significance of every single word in that sentence for the rest of the page.\nWhile not every sentence is like this, many of them are.\nAnd each one builds on the others masterfully.\nThat's the style of writing you have here.\nSong of Solomon is a book you can sit down and read in an afternoon, but it invites you to spend so much more time considering it.\n\nMorrison's books deal with a lot of heavy themes, from racism to misogyny to familial abuse.\nHer characters, for all of their struggles, are unspeakably human, which can make it all the more painful to see them through their trials.\nI cried reading this book, and there were pages where I had to sit for a bit with the weight of the words before I could continue.\n\n*Song of Solomon* in particular is unique among Morrison's works in that it was a departure from the female-focus of her other works, centering instead around a man and his story.\nBut Morrison does not leave women behind in her book, instead describing the ways a woman's interactions with society change if a man leaves her behind, as well as revealing the double standards faced by women daily, hourly, constantly.\n\nI recommend this book.\nThere's a reason Morrison is one of the most celebrated authors in the literary canon.\nThis is my first time reading one of Morrison's books, and I'm eager for more.\nI might have to wait a bit before tackling another, though.","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T01:10:10.074368139Z","tags":[]},"/books/morrison_the-bluest-eye":{"title":"The Bluest Eye","content":"\n*The Bluest Eye* by Tony Morrison is a a book about racist

it.\nAnd.\nJust.\n*Wow*.\n\n*The Gene* is a book about DNA, genetics, and a fair amount of science/biotech history.\nBut it's not *just* about that.\nY'know how when you're putting together a puzzle out of a box, you have this sort of reference picture on the box and you try to match up the pieces? When I was reading this book, each chapter felt like a puzzle piece being handed to me, and bit by bit I began to understand how it fit into the larger picture.\n\nMukherjee starts with the beginning of studies on evolution, and takes us all the way up to modern efforts in genetic therapies.\nBefore reading this book, I didn't really appreciate just how powerful statistics and actuarial math are in science—these are the tools that Mendel, among others, used to begin to understand genes and gene expression.\nFrom crossing pea strains to sequencing the human genome, this book spares no detail.\n\nDespite—or perhaps because of—his optimism for the future of genetics, Mukherjee doesn't shy away from its dark past.\nIn *The Gene*, entire sections of the book focus around the horrors of eugenics, racism, and other ways that science has been used to justify man-made horrors.\nThese aren't pleasant discussions, but I'm glad they're here.\n\nIf you're interested in biology, read this book.\nIt's made all the richer when you have modern context and a more academic or practical understanding of the content—I had a lot of fun learning about the origins of the lab procedures that I take for granted, like gene cloning and transfection.\n\nIf you hear the words \"gene\" or \"DNA\" and you don't quite know what it means, this book is a great place to start.\nMukherjee's style is very approachable while still allowing for a deep exploration of the book's topics.\nOne of my other favorite books, *[[books/mukherjee_the-song-of-the-cell|The Song of the Cell]]* (also by Siddharta

and in pop culture.\nAt the Renaissance Fair last year, I saw more than zero people dressed up as mushrooms.\nIn fact, I saw four or five people dressed up as mushrooms, which isn't that much, but it's odd considering that I usually see zero.\nFungi are fascinating things, though, and I understand a little more about why someone might want to dress up as one after reading this book.\nAlso, I can finally talk with my younger sibling about fungi and understand them.\n\n*Entangled Life* is a book about fungi.\nIt goes through all the motions you'd expect—psychedelics such as LSD, slime mold problem solving, and fermentation—and many that you wouldn't, from challenging our linear understanding of evolution to exploring enormous fungal networks in the woods.\nMerlin Sheldrake's writing is entertaining and clear—you do not need to be a mycologist to understand the book.\n\nSheldrake also expresses a lot of hope for present and future uses of fungi.\nFrom white rot fungi that can decompose toxic waste to mycelial leathers, there appears to be a fungal solution to all sorts of environmental and material issues.\nSome of the discussions on fungal upcycling and fungal materials (such as those used by [Ecovative](https://www.ecovative.com/) and [FUNGAR](https://www.fungar.eu/) remind me of the optimistic industrial views of *Cradle to Cradle*—a way to think of waste as food.\n\nHere's a list of some projects I found online about fungal projects:\n- [Press release regarding FUNGAR](https://mogu.bio/fungar-project-bbi-h2020-press-release/) (2020)\n- [The Plan to Mop Up the World's Largest Oil Spill With Fungus](https://www.vice.com/en/article/jp5k9x/the-plan-to-mop-up-the-worlds-largest-oil-spill-with-fungus) (2015)\n- [Fungi as source for new bio-based materials: a patent review](https://fungalbiolbiotech.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40694-019-0080-y) (2019)\n- [Could A Mushroom Save The Honeybee?](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/10/09/446928755/could-a-mushroom-save-the-honeybee) (2015)\n\nOne of my friends also recently began growing mushrooms in his house—I know because I stood outside with him for like three hours in March heping him pressure cook grain for it.\nAfter reading this book, I have to say that I'm interested in doing that myself, though maybe without the pressure cooking.\nI think you can find easier ways online.\n\nBut enough rambling.\n\nMerlin Sheldrake's *Entangled Life* is a great book for anyone remotely interested in fungi.\nIt's a pretty short read, too—less then 250 pages.","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T01:10:10.074368139Z","tags":[]},"/books/skloot_the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks":{"title":"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks","content":"\nIn *The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks*, Rebecca Skloot—alongside Deborah Lacks and the rest of the Lacks family—tells the story of Henrietta Lacks and the HeLa cell line that was made from her.\nIt's a bookfull of grief and frustration with a racist medical research industry.\nIt's a book about science and history.\nBut mostly, it's a book about the stubborn determination and resilience of the Lacks family.\nMuch of the book is in their own words.\n\nI first heard about this book from one of my classmates, who read it for an essay project in an English class.\nOnce I started working in a research lab and doing experiments in human cells, I felt is was important that I read it too.\nI've used [HEK293T cells](https://www.synthego.com/hek293), [3T3 cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3T3_cells), and [U2OS cells](https://www.microscopyu.com/gallery-images/human-bone-osteosarcoma-epithelial-cells-u2os-line).\nI have not used HeLa cells.\nHowever, the HeLa cell line—created using cells taken from Henrietta Lacks's cervical cancer tumor—was the first immortal cell line ever created, and paved the road for basically all of the tools of modern cell culture.\n\nGeorge Gey (pronounced like \"guy\")—the scientist who took Henrietta Lacks's cells—took them without informed consent.\nWhile this was legal, it certainly wasn't ethical.\nAlthough Gey never tried to patent HeLa cells or make money from them (in fact, he gave them out to every researcher he thought might find them useful, and refused to start a commercial cell culture firm), that doesn't what he did right.\nAnd other groups did make money off of the cells, including a firm that would later become [Invitrogen](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/brands/invitrogen.html) (a branch of the enormous Thermo-Fisher Scientific corporation).\nWe still don't have laws in place to fully prevent something like this from happening a second time.\nSkloot discusses ethics throughout the book, and moves onto the laws and conversations on patient rights in tissue sampling at the end of the book—it's a great read to the very end.\n\n*The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks* spans nations, scientific fields, and history.\nIf you're interested in history or social justice, you should read this book.\nIf you're interested in anything in the sciences, and especially if you're interested in medicine, then you *need* to read this book.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T01:10:10.074368139Z","tags":[]},"/books/smith_how-the-word-is-passed":{"title":"How the Word Is

[internet](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JekyllAndHyde) and [pop culture](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800080/).\n\nAnyways.\n*Dr.\nJekyll and Mr.\nHyde* is a quick read, barely 80 pages long.\nIt was written in 1903, and Stevenson's prose shows just how much English has changed in the past 120 years.\nIt's quite readable, but the book shows its age through peculiar turns of phrase and sentence construction.\nSome of the words use \"th\" instead of \"d\" in spelling.\n\nThe narrative itself is split into two portions.\nThe first is written in third-person, following Mr.\nUtterson's investigation into the titular case of Mr.\nHyde.\nThe second part is a series of letters and written testimony from several characters involved in the case.\nReading this book would be a very different experience for me had I not known the plot beforehand, as *Dr.\nJekyll and Mr.\nHyde* is a mystery novel.\nEven so, I had fun reading the book, especially Doctor Jekyll's final

outlines a set of best practices and techniques for writers of all stripes and skills.\nAlthough the book is described as \"The classic guide to writing nonfiction,\" much of Zissner's advice applies to fiction.\nAfter all, good writing is good writing.\nIt's the classic book to give to someone to subtly tell them they need to get better at writing.\nI read this book because my sister recommended it to me.\n\nThe book is organized into four sections: *Principles*, *Methods*, *Forms*, and *Attitudes*.\n*Principles* covers the basic principles of writing.\n*Methods* discusses the general structure of a piece of writing.\nIn *Forms*, Zissner describes the best practices specific to certain types of writing, such as science reporting and memoirs, and provides notable examples.\nFinally, in *Attitudes*, Zissner talks about the relationship between an author and their writing.\n\nFirst and foremost, Zissner advocates for a simple and clear voice in writing—\"Simplify.\nSimplify,\" he urges.\nThe greatest enemy of writing is clutter.\nBorn of passive voice and weird latinizations, clutter obfuscates the meaning of sentences.\nI tend towards the verbal clutter that Zissner so despises, though my writing never reaches the heights of corporate jargon.\n\nZissner delivers this advice in short, punchy sentences.\nThese, too, have a purpose.\nThe best sentences contain a single idea.\nIf your sentences reach for more, then split them up into two, even three or four new sentences.\nI too am guilty of overloading sentences.\nEven as I write this article, superfluous adjectives and unneeded adverbs lurk around the corner.\n\nThe section about science is good.\nZissner recommends reporting in an inverted pyramid: start with a single digestible fact, expand up, and gradually begin to cover the wider impact and finer details.\nAssume your audience is not familiar with the story, or even the field of science.\nI see these techniques across all forms of science communication, from the podcast *[Ologies](https://www.alieward.com/ologies)* (by Alie Ward) to the newsletter *[Your Local Epidemiologist](https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/)* (by Katelyn Jetelina).\nThis is the kind of writing that I want to do alongside research.\n\n\n*On Writing Well* is a book for all writers and any point in their career or life, though I think it's worth a read even for those of us who don't see ourselves as writers.\nThe chapters are self-contained and only as long as they need to be—and you don't have to read every chapter like you might in a novel.\nInstead of describing the rest of the book here, I instead recommend you borrow out a copy and read it for yourself.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T01:10:10.074368139Z","tags":[]},"/code/fixing-workspaces-plus":{"title":"Fixing Workspaces Plus Plugin","content":"\nFrom [this

The YTK uses [[Golden Gate Cloning]] techniques and the MoClo part syntax as a design framework.\n\n## Toolkit Taxonomy\nYTK has three \"types\" of plasmids:\n- Part plasmids are not ready for expression in yeast. Instead, these are like your catalog of sequences. These plasmids have BsaI binding sites that are used to define the part type.\n- Cassette plasmids are complete transcriptional units. These are assembled from one of each part plasmid. This is the beauty of the YTK—you can easily mix and match and make an entirely new cassete in about half an hour.\n- Multigene plasmids are assembled from the transcriptional units in cassette plasmids, and allow expression of multiple genes. This makes transformation much more convenient, since it uses only a single plasmid for expression.\n\nTo use a sequence with the toolkit, you have to go through a process of \"domesticating\" it into the kit taxonomy, assembling it into a part plasmid. From there, you can begin building your transcriptional units.\n\n![[_media/moclo-workflow.png]]\n\n## MoClo Golden Gate Syntax\nMoClo syntax divides sequences into different types depending on the purpose of the DNA:\n1. Assembly connectors. This set goes at the start of the TU. These are used in cassette plasmids to define where that transcriptional unit will fit in a multi-gene plasmid.\n2. Promoters.\n3. Coding sequences. This is where the sequence for your protein of interest goes.\n4. Terminator.\n5. Assembly Connectors. These ones go at the end of the TU.\n6. Yeast marker.\n7. Yeast origin.

Modular domains can then be used to design new constructs and networks.\n\nFor example, you could take sensor domain from a protein and attach it to something else, or swap around the domain that starts signal transduction. You could end up changing the stimuli or response to it, and thus influence overall cell dynamics!\n\nThe difficulty with this strategy is that you never know quite what you're going to get from your new constructs. Removing one domain might ruin the protein folding and then break your whole peptide chain!\n\n## Circular permutation\nThe alternative approach to domain shuffling is to reuse domains from the same protein, but in a different order. While this is much more difficult to do well than lateral domain shuffling, it can produce very interesting results (like circular fluorescent proteins[^circular-gfp]).\n\nIt's called circular permutation because you put the end of the protein at the front, typically.\n\n\n[^circular-gfp]: Kostyuk, A.I., Demidovich, A.D., Kotova, D.A., Belousov, V.V., and Bilan, D.S.
